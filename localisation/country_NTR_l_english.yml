NTR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC1:0 "Northern edges of the Griffonia have always been a mysterious place - land of magic and harsh winters. Yet, despite the difficulties, tribes of Tir Deighe have flourished, living in peace with nature and Spirits. Now however, after the invasion of communists from the south, ponies were forced to fight a war they could not easily win. After two decades, the situation has reached a breaking point - reformers call for changes, while much darker forces have arisen to undermine the status quo in the North. Only time will till, if tribes will be able to weather the gathering storm..."

### State Description ###
state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_562:0 "Everfrost"
 state_lore_text_container_state_name_562:0 "The §YCity§! of the §YCrystal Spires§!"
 state_lore_text_container_state_description_562:0 "It is a common belief across the world, that there are no cities in northern §YGriffonia§! - just bunches of shacks and log cabins, scattered along the frozen wasteland. It makes foreigners even more surprised when they visit §CEverfrost§! - capital of §YTir Deighe§! and its largest city. History of Everfrost begins with the unification of the §Ynorthern tribes§! by §CCainnech Snowflake§!. The great mages and craftsponies started to build then a structure, known today as §YSnowflake Palace§!, as a residence of a new king and a place of gatherings of the clans. It is said that the Palace was rather “grown”, than built, using techniques that were later forgotten - and druids managed to shape crystals into seven magnificent spires, that are the highest structures in the city.\n\nAs centuries have passed, the city slowly grew, becoming a main centre of commerce of Tir Deighe. After merchants, craftsponies followed, and when a §Ygreat library§! was created in the halls of Snowflake Palace, many ponies travelled to Evefrost to study knowledge of the previous generations. As a result Everfrost does not resemble any other city in Griffonia - it is a place of art and beauty, with even the smallest buildings being elaborately decorated through generations. Ponies tended to expand their dwellings both on the surface and below it - and one can see how next owners expanded homes they inherited - wanting to match the accomplishments of their ancestors. Of course one cannot forget about the §YGreat Clans§! - each of them, as a matter of honour, erected a large §Yspire-mansion§!, mimicking the royal palace as a show of clan wealth and power.\n\nHowever, years of war with §RSkynavia§! have also affected the Everfrost - though not directly attacked, it was flooded with §Yrefugees§! who now inhabit makeshift districts constructed on the outskirts of the capital. Warbands stop here, before marching to the front, and workshops produce weapons rather than works of art. Peace and harmony of the Everfrost are gone - perhaps forever, yet the city still remains the symbol of pony unity and their ingenuity."

NTR_open_frostbell_desc:0 "Per request of Euan Stormshield we shall let his clan engage into trade with outsiders through the port of Frostbell - it will both help the city to grow and let us better control contacts with foreigners."
NTR_riders_storm:0 "Riders of the Storm"
NTR_riders_storm_desc:0 "Our Pegasii learned how to fly in even the most dangerous conditions - neither snow nor storm are able to stop them. It gives us a large recruitment pool of experienced fliers we can use."
NTR_limited_contacts:0 "Limited Contacts"
NTR_limited_contacts_desc:0 "Though we might need them, we should not overly fraternize with the outsiders. Trade with foreign merchants will be limited to a few chosen locations and handled by clan Stormshield, so the rest of us don’t have to be bothered by them."
NTR_foreign_tech:0 "Foreign Technology"
NTR_foreign_tech_desc:0 "There is no doubt that if we keep relying solely on our own capabilities we will never be able to rival more developed nations. However there is a simple solution - we shall simply purchase and copy foreign devices. "
NTR_import_planes:0 "Import Airplanes"
NTR_import_planes_desc:0 "Plane is truly a fascinating invention, one that makes pegasii be overly excited - we can only guess it’s about speed... Let’s buy them some, and hopefully they’ll stop whining."
NTR_profit:0 "Profit from Our Riches"
NTR_profit_desc:0 "Furs, lumber, minerals, products of our artisans... There are lots of commodities we can sell abroad, and receive a decent payment for these. Clan Stormshield, which concentrated nearly the entire trade in its hooves, grows richer and richer every day - and tribes as a whole benefit from this deal."
NTR_royal_academy:0 "The Royal Academy"
NTR_royal_academy_desc:0 "We received a peculiar request from clan Stormshield - while most of our nation's foals are being educated by druids or during their apprenticeship, Stormshields want to create a proper “university”, where they would pass the southrons knowledge and teach in a way they do. Considering they want to fund this establishment and just ask for patronage - why not let them."
NTR_strike_enemies:0 "Strike the Enemy"
NTR_strike_enemies_desc:0 "Plane is largely superior to pegasii in one regard - when pegasii could throw rocks, you can throw bombs using a plane. Much more efficient."
NTR_defend_skies:0 "Defend Our Skies"
NTR_defend_skies_desc:0 "It is likely our enemies will have a largely numerically superior air force - we should focus on intercepting their planes and preventing them from attacking our territory."

NTR_teacher_village:0 "Teachers in Every Village"
NTR_teacher_village_desc:0 "Many members of clan Brigthflame lives among other tribes or wanders the land, providing help to whoever asks. We should take inspiration from these sages and send teachers to even the most remote corners of our domain."

NTR_supplies_for_alchemists_desc:0 "It is incredible how much time alchemists lose looking for rare ingredients. If we provide them with all the supplies these wise ponies need, they should be able to produce them much faster"
NTR_fortitude_elixir:0 "Elixir of Fortitude"
NTR_fortitude_elixir_desc:0 "Brightflames agreed to share with a recipe of their famed elixir of fortitude. This potion saved the lives of many travellers, who faced sudden snowstorms or got lost in wilderness, letting them push forward without rest or food for many hours."
NTR_healing_herbs:0 "Plant Healing Herbs"
NTR_healing_herbs_desc:0 "Rarity of herbs and plants of magical qualities severely limits our ability to produce large quantities of medicines. These plants require high quality soil, and proper care, making only a few ponies able to farm them. Nevertheless we should try to develop techniques that will let us harvest more of these precious plants."
NTR_tame_beasts:0 "Tame the Beasts"
NTR_tame_beasts_desc:0 "The feared Ursas are among the most dangerous creatures one can encounter in the northern lands. If tamed, they may however prove to be an extremely useful addition to our army."

NTR_strive_to_perfection:0 "Strive to Perfection"
NTR_strive_to_perfection_desc:0 "Moltenrocks perfectionism can be at a time irritating - they keep destroying items others would consider decent, and start again... and again... and again..."
NTR_weaponised_magic:0 "Weaponised Magic"
NTR_weaponised_magic_desc:0 "If a unicorn can cast a spell, then we can't enchant a gun to achieve a similar effect? "
NTR_share_knowledge:0 "Spread Their Knowledge"

NTR_blessed_guns:0 "Blessed Guns"
NTR_blessed_guns_desc:0 "Moltenrocks believe that with proper ritual, the Spirit of Metal can bless magical guns they create. With such supernatural assistance, we should be able to deal with many recurring issues of such equipment."
NTR_spirit_machine:0 "Spirit in the Machine"
NTR_spirit_machine_desc:0 "Some metalshapers claim that their patron Spirit is most pleased by the sight of such magnificent creations as tanks - and would gladly accept such a vessel for him. How can an enemy defeat our tanks, if they are avatars of a deity?"

NTR_crystal_clear_desc:0 "We have already been using crystals in numerous ways, including as building material - the spires of our capital are the best example of it. However we need to exploit new deposits, if we wish to continue development of crystal architecture."

NTR_arts_and_crafts:0 "Arts and Crafts"
NTR_arts_and_crafts_desc:0 "The industry destroys the nations - it turns creatures into cogs in machines, pollutes the land and souls and destroys any uniqueness in favour of uniformity and efficiency. Our way will be the way of craftsmen - and striving to perfection only they can achieve."
NTR_many_shapes:0 "Many Shapes of Ships"
NTR_many_shapes_desc:0 "Shipwrights explained  for hours the differences between various types to us, but we remembered nothing - just that there were many, many difficult words. Why do sailors and other seaponies use so many difficult, weird words?!"
NTR_roam_the_waves_trad:0 "Roam the Waves"

NTR_polar_warships:0 "Polar Warships"
NTR_polar_warships_desc:0 "Our shipwrights want to create bigger and more deadly warships - there is no reason why we would not let them to. Strong fleet is a necessity if we want to protect our borders."
NTR_floating_icebergs:0 "Floating Icebergs"
NTR_floating_icebergs_desc:0 "It’s weird no one actually taught before about it - we shall enchant smaller icebergs to be used as hulls of our warships. In this way we can create warships much faster and be harder to destroy - after all it’s not easy to crack a floating mountain! Only issue is ensuring the iceberg will not melt..."

NTR_age_of_magic:0 "Age of Magic"
NTR_age_of_magic_desc:0 "Times are changing - age of blood and steel is approaching, time of industry and science... So at least say griffons - and they are wrong. We will revive the great magic of old, and create wonders like never before."
NTR_connect_clans:0 "Connect the Clans"

NTR_crystal_architecture:0 "Crystal Architecture"

NTR_applications_of_ice:0 "The Many Applications of Ice"
NTR_applications_of_ice_desc:0 "Magic crystals are relatively rare. However one of our mages came up with an idea of enchanting ice, so it could be used to replace crystals - it will require significant effort, but the results will be worth it."
NTR_limitless_potential:0 "Limitless Potential"
NTR_limitless_potential_desc:0 "There are many secrets of magic we yet have not uncovered. Every day our mages discover more and more applications of old knowledge and devise a new one. Our future will be bright, and it will be filled with magic!"
NTR_the_jewel:0 "The Jewel of the North"
NTR_the_jewel_desc:0 "Everfrost, the City of Crystal Spires, Jewel of the North...

NTR_follow_old:0 "Follow the Old Way"

NTR_redeem_ice:0 "Redeem Circle of Ice"
NTR_redeem_ice_desc:0 "Many of the Speakers of the Dead have followed the Archdruid and were subsequently lost to his madness. However, not whole Circle was destroyed by actions of Gavin and its surviving members pledged to do all within their power to redeem themselves"
NTR_rally_lodges:0 "Rally the Lodges"
NTR_rally_lodges_desc:0 "Many warriors, grouped in lodges, fight in the west against Skynavians, or fend off attacks by griffon raiders. They lack guidance and single command. However with the majority of clans supporting us, they will listen to the call of the princess."
NTR_meet_euan:0 "Meet with Euan"
NTR_meet_euan_desc:0 "Euan Stormshield, the leader of reform minded clans, keeps undermining the authority of the princess and calls for radical reforms. However, despite our differences he still deeply cares for northern ponies - and should be willing to support our fight against Skynavians."
NTR_unity_call:0 "Call for Unity"
NTR_unity_call_desc:0 "Currently our warriors fight divided and various chiefs keep bickering among themselves. We must convince them to cooperate."
NTR_solidarity:0 "Solidarity with Exiles"
NTR_solidarity_desc:0 "To ease the hardships suffered by our exiled brothers we will ask eastern clans to help settle them and provide them with necessary help - though some may frown upon giving up their land to members of other clans, hopefully kinship between our kind will prevail."

NTR_discipline_them:0 "Discipline Them"
NTR_discipline_them_desc:0 "Despite some issues with disciplines, militias proved their usefulness. Fighting alongside their clansponies, our warriors will be much more fierce and the structure of warbands ensures many new recruits. We just need to ensure they follow the single command and all should be fine."
NTR_princess_army:0 "Princess’ Army"
NTR_princess_army_desc:0 "We won more by sheer luck rather than the competence of our army. Though many will not like it, we need to completely reform our military into a more modern force, abolishing old tribal warbands and creating one, unified army."
NTR_princess_of_all:0 "Princess of All"

NTR_reopen_refinery:0 "Reopen Refinery"
NTR_reopen_refinery_desc:0 "Due to the erratic nature of their government and harsh environment, Skynavians were not able to provide a steady flow of oil from Ostfloy Refinery. Clan Moltenrock however promised to make it work in no time."
NTR_mine_littlegriff:0 "Mine the Little Griff"
NTR_mine_littlegriff_desc:0 "Little Griff mountains were used by Skynavians to provide them with all kinds of needed metals. We can use old skynavian mines for our own benefit."
NTR_stratify_society:0 "Stratify Society"
NTR_stratify_society_desc:0 "North is our home and we should be the ones to make the rules. Skynavians are foreign invaders, and though we forgave them, they cannot be let to rule. Of course some generalisation would be harmful for the few griffons who lived here for decades or even centuries and always stood by our side. We simply need some stratification... "
NTR_friendship_between_races:0 "Friendship Between Races"
NTR_friendship_between_races_desc:0 "Many centuries ago, northern ponies united, leaving aside their petty conflicts and forging a kinship among clans. There is no reason why we cannot extend our hoof towards griffons."

NTR_we_are_different:0 "We are Different..."
NTR_we_are_different_desc:0 "It is an obvious fact that differences between ponies and griffons are irreconcilable, on both personal and societal level. Instead of trying to force griffons to be like us, it would be best to let both groups live in their separate communities under our benevolent reign."
NTR_fate_of_communes:0 "Fate of the Communes"
NTR_fate_of_communes_desc:0 "While dealing with city dwelling Skynavians is relatively easy, there is a much more complicated issue - various radical and often reclusive communes which can be found in the west. "

NTR_we_can_be_equals_desc:0 "Yesterday we were enemies - hopefully tomorrow we will be friends - it will for sure take time, but griffons will learn from us how to become part of the North, and perhaps we too can learn valuable lessons from our feathered neighbours."
NTR_ice_curtain:0 "Ice Curtain"
NTR_ice_curtain_desc:0 "To ensure our safety we shall prepare a line of fortifications alongside our southern border. This, with a combination of mountainous terrain and harsh conditions should be enough to stop enemies with numerical advantage."
NTR_unification:0 "Unification of the Northerners"

NTR_reform_milita:0 "Reform Our Militia"

NTR_foreign_instructors:0 "Foreign Instructors"

NTR_from_warbands_desc:0 "First step to create a proper army is to get rid of the old tribal structure of warbands and replace it with one, unified force, led by career soldiers, not the biggest and loudest pony in a clan, as it is common in militias."
NTR_copy_griffon:0 "Copy Griffon Designs"
NTR_copy_griffon_desc:0 "Either through trade or as spoils of war, we took possession of lots of griffon weaponry. Our gunsmiths believe we should be able to copy them."

NTR_perils_logistics:0 "Perils of Logistics"

NTR_our_gunsmiths:0 "Our Own Gunsmiths"

NTR_digging_trenches:0 "Digging, Digging Trenches"
NTR_digging_trenches_desc:0 "As we refine our military doctrine, it becomes obvious that defense is the best offense. By fortifying we can defeat even the stronger military, by letting them bleed out during pointless assaults. So get this shovel and dig the trench!"
NTR_we_gotta_go_fast:0 "We've Gotta Go Fast"
NTR_we_gotta_go_fast_desc:0 "Speed! Enemies can’t hit us, if they cannot get us - and by outmaneuvering enemies we can push deep into their territory, depriving them of supplies and ravaging their industry."
NTR_mass_production:0 "From Artifacts to Mass Production"
NTR_mass_production_desc:0 "Powerful artifacts let the heroes of old slay whole regiments of enemies - however creating even one such weapon was an arduous task. Instead we should focus on producing much more modern magical weaponry and equipping as many ponies with it as possible."

NTR_everfrost_mil_college:0 "Everfrost Military College"
NTR_everfrost_mil_college_desc:0 "Until now our military education relied solely on battlefield experience - or whatever knowledge you could get from your older companions. Time to end this and create a proper school where young officers will get proper training."
NTR_strength_in_numbers:0 "Strength in Numbers"

NTR_new_raiders:0 "New Raiders"

NTR_look_beyond_sea_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia, an old griffon colony on Equus is one of the most powerful nations nearby. They would make an excellent ally - and perhaps a prospect of getting a foothold on Griffonia will be enough to convince them to let us join the Northern Bloc."

NTR_march_on_brantbeak_desc:0 "South of us in the Brantbeak region live many clans of griffons - sometimes we traded with them, but most of the time they kept raiding us. Now this land is filled with bandits, republicans and communists. Time has come to clean up this mess."

NTR_get_rid_of_obstacles_desc:0 "Many clans still oppose our vision and try to delay the inevitable.

ntribes.01.d:0 "When Fiana was younger, she loved to play in a maze of corridors that Snowflake Palace was composed of. Generation after generation it was expanded - both upward and below, to show the glory of the prince dynasty of the north. Seven crystal towers rose well above other structures of this kind in the Evefrost - known not without a reason as “City of the Crystal Spires''. Now however it felt... empty. It’s not like there were no other ponies living here, in fact it was quite the opposite - the royal guard, librarians caring for a vast collection of books, servants... However, except for a few old servants, she had no one she could entrust her fears and doubts with. Her mother perished years ago, stricken by a disease, her father and brothers died fighting the wretched Skynavians... When she, the last of the Snowflake - then just a scared filly was crowned years ago, she did not yet know what kind of burden was bestowed upon her shoulders. She tried her best - but it seems that all attempts have failed - griffons were slowly winning, and she could do nothing to stop them.\nEvery day she listened to pleas of other ponies and tried to ease disputes among clans - but as time passed, fewer and fewer even cared for her opinion. More and more listened to Euan Stormshield and his griffon friend, Oscar Plumenjar. She had nothing personal against Oscar, he was a charming person and lived among ponies for many years, respecting their ways... But Euan used him to preach a message of “becoming more like griffons”. Perhaps it was the way? Perhaps old ways, the ways of her father and countless ancestors have indeed failed? Doubts, endless doubts... The impending Great Council will be decisive - she could feel that. Her support could be decisive..."

ntribes.02.t:0 "The Forbidden Knowledge"
ntribes.02.d:0 "The priests of Ice were rare guests in Snowflake Palace - they always tended to stay in their ice vaults, and left them only if dire need appeared. It was even weirder then, that Gavin the Frost Beard decided to personally arrive at the capital and requested an audience. The Druid was... ancient - frail and white haired, he looked like he could be as old as the palace itself, and rumors about his age ranged anywhere from ninety to three hundred years... He moved however surprisingly swiftly.\n“Princess Fiana...” Druid said as he approached a throne and slightly bowed. \n“Archdruid Gavin, pleasure to host you in the capital... Bring the venerable Gavin a chair!” She ordered servants. The Druid quickly took a seat with a sigh of relief.\n“Thank you, your highness. My knees are not as good as they used to be... Buut, it’s not the reason why I asked for an audience, princess. We, in a Circle of Ice are aware, how dire the situation is... And we might have a solution for our problems. One of my students has recently found a map that may lead us to the Vault of Broken Swords...”\n“Isn’t it a place where Kings of Blizzard, defeated by my forefather, were buried, along with their armies?” Interrupted Fiana. \n“Precisely, your highness! I must admit I am surprised you heard this story and must praise your diligence in studying old stories...” Archdruid smiled warmly. “If only more young ponies cared to study history... But getting to the point... You probably know what the story says about powers the Blizzard Kings held, and how they crushed entire griffon armies that tried to conquer our lands...”\n“I also know that they were consumed by their powers and later ruled like tyrants. It was my ancestor that defeated them, and freed eastern tribes.” Replied the princess.\n“Yes, that’s unfortunate.” Old pony nodded. “But I studied old legends my whole life... I believe it was not the power itself that corrupted them, but darkness in their hearts. We need such might, ponies once wielded, princesses. And once war is over, we will bury the old knowledge where its place, to not use it unless in time of greatest need...”\nFiana stayed silent... She knew these stories - about ponies whose hearts turned into ice, and who were bloodthirsty tyrants. But indeed - they were once great heroes of the ponykind, who fought with all kinds of creatures - both mortal and supernatural who threatened the ponykind... And well - she knew the archdruid - he was once a friend of her father and was always kind to her. He was a good pony, and she could trust him..."

ntribes.07.d:0 "Sky turned dark - starting from the east, it slowly turned from usual blue into darkest black - darker than even during summer storms... Something was coming - and it made her tremble in fear. She looked around - however there was nothing she could hide behind - all around her, up till horizon there was only a flat, ice wasteland. And even if - she could not move even for an inch, paralyzed by a fear of what was coming...\nA blizzard - an unstoppable force that came from the east, was closer and closer - and the only thing she could do was to stand and watch as it came closer and closer...\nShe woke up, when a blizzard hit her - like many nights before, today she also suffered from recurring nightmares. Recently it was getting worse and the feeling of anxiety was returning even during daytime. Something was wrong, she knew it... Many druids have approached her, claiming something is wrong - spirits were angered and... terrified, and it affected those susceptible to their influence - and as a member of Snowflake clan she had special ties to the northern spirits...\nBut what could have caused it? Her thoughts followed archdruid Gavin - it’s been weeks since he travelled to the Valley, with few of his students - and there was no news about what happened there. Perhaps it was a bad decision to let him go... Only thing she could do now was to wait - no one except the archdruid and ponies who followed him knew the way to the long forgotten crypts..."

ntribes.06.t:0 "Wayward Druid"
ntribes.06.d:0 "We just received news - apparently archdruid Gavin ignored princess’ will and with a group of most trusted students, headed east towards Vault of Broken Swords. Those in the Circle of Ice who disagreed with Gavin decided to warn us - and with their help we may be able to track the archdruid and prevent him from releasing whatever malevolent forces were buried in this cursed place."
ntribes.06.a:0 "Gather warriors!"
ntribes.08.t:0 "Vault of Broken Swords"
ntribes.08.d:0 "If not for Sorcha, they would never have even a remote chance to find Vault among all these snow covered rocks. Sudden blizzard masked the tracks left by Gavin and his students, therefore making traditional ways of tracking impossible - luckily a young druid was able to navigate, using barely visible symbols left by creators of the vault.\nFor many hours a group of warriors was traversing a vast valley. Despite being veterans of two decades of war with griffons, battle-hardened ponies huddled together... Something was wrong with this place, yet they could not say what exactly. For sure, even nature seemed to avoid this godforsaken place - they heard no birds and even the trees were in some unnatural way deformed and... twisted.\nTheir destination was near - a large barrow, whose entrance was once blocked by enormous rock - now broken into pieces by an unknown force. Warriors drew their weapons and entered inside. Walls inside were covered in symbols of long forgotten language - known only to a few, eldest members of the Circle of Ice - yet even a remote knowledge she possessed, made Sorcha shudder, as she tried to decipher symbols.\n“It is some kind of warning... Damnation and undoing of soul... And pleads for mercy for those who are burrowed here. We must hurry.”\nWarriors grumbled in confirmation and followed the druid. Soon the ground started to lower, and the group entered the underground part of the vault. Wood and earth were replaced by ice, and beyond it one could see vaguely pony shapes - typical way of burial for northern ponies. Though the vault resembles rather a maze, the druid led a group firmly forward, heading in a direction only she knew was the correct one. Young mare was moving stiffly as if each step required overcoming an invisible obstacle. It took a long time, but finally they reached a large chamber. But even before they entered it, they all could feel a metallic smell..."

ntribes.09.t:0 "Forging an Alliance"
ntribes.09.d:0 "East to the Elf Lake lies a famed Holy Forge - a seat of power of the Moltenrock clan, from which a bulk of magical sword and armour used by northern ponies originated. One of the five great clans, and only one composed nearly solely of unicorns, a Moltenrock clan was among the most influential and rich of tribes. Even though spears and swords could not beat modern fireguns, without a steady flow of equipment originating from the clan's forge, the pony situation would be even more dramatic. Other ponies however often considered Moltenrocks to be a bit... unhinged - for sure a normal pony would not want to live next to a volcano, and harness its power using magic... Not to say about their unhealthy fascination with fire and metal... Many ponies in the forge were wearing metal masks or even had their body parts replaced with magitek prosthetics that sometimes looked... disturbing.\n“I must say, it’s quite an impressive piece of machinery...” One such pony was currently examining a machine gun imported from the south. Half of his face was covered with burns, and eye was replaced by a crudely shaped crystal, placed in a metal socket. “Older metalshapers were for years opposing the usage of gunpowder and griffon technology, claiming it lacks... soul. But with such marvellous examples of engineering, even they are getting excited by the prospect of improving it...”\n“So...” Oscar Plumenjar cleared his throat to get over enthusiastic pony attention. “Do we have a deal?”\n“Ah yes... Yes, we have. Clan Moltenrock will support Stormshields as long as we will be the first ones to study any foreign technology which will be obtained. We will support you during the Council.”\n“Thank you.” Oscar nodded his head. “I’m sure our cooperation will be bountiful for all.”\n“Yes, yes, I’m sure it will... But if I may ask... Why are you, as a griffon, supporting the Euan cause and helping us fight other griffons? And why really bother with our clan politics?” Magitek's eye turned towards Oscar, while the organic one was still focused on the machine gun. Griffon almost shuddered seeing such an unnatural move...\n“Well... I love this land, its traditions... Ponies accepted me and helped when I was exiled... It’s my home, more than Cloudbury. And I do not want to see it overrun by Skynavians... Even if it requires ponies to be more like griffons...”\n“It’s old chiefs talking.” Smirked unicorn. “We need to protect old ways. But you know what? They forgot that here in the north you always need to change and adapt if you want to survive. It’s like smelting metal and pouring it into a new form. It’s of a different shape, more useful now...”"
ntribes.09.a:0 "“...but it’s still the same metal.”"
ntribes.54.t:0 "The Aftermath"
ntribes.54.d:0 "Only one pony returned from the group we sent to the Vault. Young druid refused to answer any questions about what exactly happened in the Vault, saying just that both the warriors and archdruid Gavin have perished, and after that she collapsed the entrance and destroyed all signs that could let anyone else find this cursed place. Soon after that, she left Evefrost - with the last traces of her found in the southern mountains. Hopefully no one else will try to find the Vault and per our request Circle of Ice has destroyed all documents in their archives that may contain information about its location."

ntribes.03.t:0 "The Clans"
ntribes.03.d:0 "Petty rivalries and generations-long feuds are a norm in the Tìr Deighe - even though all conflicts are regulated by a set of ancient customs and laws, northern ponies are stubborn ones and easy to be offended. For centuries the most important job of the princes and princesses was to mediate and be a neutral judge - one, whose word was respected even by the oldest and most obstinate clan elders.\nThough there are many clans, so called Five Great Clans are the ones who actually “run” the nation - and all the petty tribes are usually in one way or another related or allied to one of the Great Five. Each of these clans has been blessed by one of the Spirits and its members were often blessed with specific kinds of elemental magic. When Cainnech Snowflake unified the tribes, they began to work together for greater good - and thanks to spirit magic they turned northern tundra into thriving land.\nArrival of Skynavians changed everything - before that, interactions with southrons were rare - occasional trade and raids conducted by bandits living in mountains or young vedinian knights looking for glory were considered normal, but only the always restless Stormshields were eager to contact outsiders. Now, when the Skynavian threat looms in the west, many started to listen to Stormshields and adopted more and more of griffon technology. Famed artificers of the clan Moltenrock have already allied with Euan Stormshield and so did many smaller clans. There were rumors that Barkcoats may also be willing to support them... It made Brightflames and Greenhooves a minority in tribal council - even if they were supported by the Speakers of the Dead, which though not a clan, thanks to their role as custodians of clans history held a substantial amount of influence.\nAs alliances shifted, Princess Fiana found herself in a precarious situation - many expected her to support the cause of traditionalist clans, but in that way she would alienate a large number of northern ponies... Even now however her word still had a certain power, and whoever she supports - would benefit greatly during the Great Council."

ntribes.04.t:0 "Friend from the East"
ntribes.04.d:0 "City of Frostbell... Well - “city”, as it was more a collection of fisherponies’ huts and houses, taverns and other “establishments”, visited by sailors crazy enough to sail around the Dread Peninsula to travel east - towards rich pony nations of the Riverlands. The route was a dangerous one, plagued by changeling or hillpony pirates and deadly beasts, borned from dark magic that held the Peninsula in its clutches. But it was also immensely profitable - a daring captain could sell furs, crystals or works of art and bring modern weapons from Bakara... And there was always a need for weapons during the seemingly eternal struggle with Skynavians...\nSudden blow of wind made Euan tremble - he covered himself tighter with a furry coat and stopped daydreaming about distant lands... Ship was slowly approaching, and after a few minutes it moored to the wharf. A small, steam powered freighter was nevertheless the largest ship in port. After a few more minutes, when the crew was busy unloading crates, a young mare went down the ladder. Euan waved to her.\n“Amber, over here!” A mare quickly trotted towards him and they hugged each other.\n“Long time not seen!” She laughed. “I hope you did not have to wait too long.”\n“Three day delay is not that bad considering... By the way, how was the journey?” Asked Euan\n“Surprisingly quiet, only once something that resembled a giant shark tried to ram us... How are things here?”\n“Same as usual, the princess does not know what to do, old pricks say all was better before the Skynavians, snow was whiter, grass was green...” Stormshield shook his arms. “And how about...”\n“...the deal? Good, even very good.\nThough I did not manage to talk with anypony of power, there were more than enough businessponies interested in this little... venture. If you secure the northern passage, they will pay us handsomely and are willing to invest in our mining operations.”"

ntribes.55.d:0 "The Hall of Gathering was filled with ponies - elders of the clans, their advisors, allies and various “guests of honour”... Princess welcomed one delegation after another, desperately trying to recall all the names of those of the ponies she hadn't met for years... Later, her servants showed each group their seats - all was carefully planned to avoid placing feuding clans next to each other and avoid brawl... Suddenly doors opened with loud “BLAM”, hitting the walls as if pushed by some powerful force. Behind it stood a group of ponies, wearing ceremonial robes of the druids of the Ice - including hoods covering their faces. Nevertheless Fiana recognised the old pony leading them - it was archdruid Gavin himself.\n“Venerable Gavin!” Fiana welcomed him. “Long time no see... I trust your journey was fruitful?”\n“More than you can imagine, princess.” Said Gavin. There was no trace of elderly weakness in his voice - he sounded like a pony in his best years could. “I have returned from the Vault of Broken Swords with knowledge... And solution to all our problems.”\n“From where?!” Head of the clan Moltenrock nearly choked hearing this. “Princess, what is he talking about? I thought it’s just a legend to scare naughty foals!”\n“It’s not a legend!” Disagreed one of the invited druids. “But for a very good reason it was nearly forgotten. It was a place of great evil... “ Pony shuddered. “Archdruid, explain what...” Princess tried to speak, but Gavin was quicker.\n“Elders and clans leaders...” He started to talk while walking forward, completely ignoring Fiana. “For years I was looking for a solution to bring us salvation. To defeat our enemies and let us take a position we, ponies, deserve. And what did others, who try to lead the ponies of the north, do? Just pointlessly argued, unable to find a way to save our kind. They wanted to imitate the despicable griffons.” Druid pointed towards Euan Stormshield.\n“Or misunderstood what it really means to honor the way of our ancestors, binded by superstitious fear... All of you know stories of the winters that lasted for years, of ice storms so destructive, they razed entire cities... And I found a way to unleash such powers. Not only this, but also how to create armies that will slaughter the griffons! Behold!” Group of ponies accompanying him took off their hoods, revealing the faces of the long dead, raised from their ice graves, their faces still covered with not melting hoarfrost. Archdruid himself removed his own robe - his eyes were blank, and there was a large scar on his chest - and beneath it - a pulsating blue light. The reactions of the crowd were mixed - some ponies were clearly fascinated with this sight and by druids words, others - terrified or disgusted.\n“I have liberated myself from the shackles of life and death!” Gavin nearly screamed. “And so may you, who will follow me. Great power awaits all of us. We will no longer serve weak spirits, instead we will command them! Join me, so we can finally inflict our revenge upon griffons! For every slayed pony, we shall slay tenfold as many griffons! Winter shall be eternal and we will be its masters!” There was something hypnotic about Gavin's words, something that exaggerated all the anger and hatred ponies felt...\nAfter a brief moment of silence, one of the druids shook off the shock.\n“This is sacrilege! Madness and sacrilege! Stop this madpony!” What followed was utter chaos - many ponies drew their weapons. Few less brave ponies decided to run from the Hall... Archdruid simply raised his hoof...\nVortex of snow and ice surrounded him - shards of razor sharp ice started to tear apart those who dared to oppose him - and his resurrected warriors also joined a slaughter, as those who decided to join Gavin fought the rest of the assembly.. . After a few minutes the hall was filled with bodies, and the floor was slippery of all the blood that was spilled - but the archdruid and his followers were victorious. Princess Fiana just stood there in the middle of this madhouse - unable to move, tears ran down her face..., terrified but all this mindless slaughter.\n“Well... I hope their successors will be more... willing to cooperate. And about rest... You made a wise choice, friends. The task ahead of us is great... But we will prevail. No, go to your clans and bring them joyful news. We are going to war.\n“To war! Revenge!” Screamed the gathered, raising their weapons.\n“Good.” Smiled Archdruid. “Get the princess.” He ordered his undead henchponies. “We will need her.”\nFew miles away from the city, thousands of undead soldiers were marching towards the capital..."

But rarely one has the opportunity to see a coronation - and indeed a first one of its very kind. Today, princess Fiana was meant to be crowned Queen of the North. With this act a new state would be born - a nation of both ponies and griffons. Many of the foreign guests were astounded by the fact that ponies managed to conquer such vast swathes of northern Griffonia, but even if it seemed improbable - it indeed happened, and few could deny how astounding victory it was. Eyes of everyone were turned towards Fiana, as she was crowned by the eldest of druids with a newly forged crown. Chieftains, elders of the clans and leaders of the griffons kneeled to pay homage to their new sovereign - and one of them shouted loudly “Long live the Queen! Long live the united North!”. Moments later the rest followed. But while crowds praised Fiana, the true architect of this moment oversaw the whole ceremony from one of the balconies. Euan smiled warmly - years of his work finally paid off, years of plotting, fighting and arduous diplomacy... He was tired - tired, but happy.\n“They should belaud you instead.” Shouts of the crowd let Amber to approach without alerting Euan. “You are after all the one who made it possible. And now they will probably write in the books something like *princess wise leadership united the north and brought peace to it*”.\n“They probably will.” Responded Euan. “But I never cared much for the splendor of rulership. It can get rather boring I think, considering how princesses tend to behave. And all these empty rituals... I needed more action.”\n“Yeah, that sounds like you... So what now?”\n“Well... There is still some work to do, problems will not disappear only because our ruler has a fancy new title... I guess it will keep me busy for a few years. And later... I think I’ll go to see all these places I read about. Perhaps Equestria? From what you told me, it is truly marvelous.”\n“It is.” Smiled Amber. “Well, when you decide to retire from being a shadowy figure behind a throne, I guess I can be your guide.”"

The North was in fact abundant in natural resources - however ponies never needed to exploit them. Times have changed however - and these resources could be used to finance a war - and later a modernisation of the nation. Euan sent more envoys to Riverlands - with promises of great wealth in return for help. And luckily for the northern ponies - there were Riverlanders interested in what the North could offer - namely a deposit of gold, which they could freely exploit, and for which purpose would Euan provide them with labourers. There was however a problem - it lay on the land considered holy by one of the smaller clans.  However it was not an issue that could not be solved - elders just had to be convinced through monetary means this land was not ‘that’ holy - and even if many still considered it a sacrilege...

To add insult to injury , some older chieftains were seemingly opposing any change because they were not the ones who proposed it - and letting anyone else decide the matters of their clan... It would be dishonourable! It took Euan years to convince first his own clan and later Moltenrocks to support him - and Barkcoats followed only because of princess support. In moments like this, Stormshield did not envied Fiana and her ancestors - ruling the North was an absolute nightmare. Normally he would spend a few more years trying to get support from other clans - but there was no time for such cautious actions. Luckily, every chieftain and elder has few power hungry and ambitious underlings - who being younger were much more susceptible to Euan’s words - and if helped would be in debt to him - and debt is a serious thing in the North.\nThere were of course a few clans which due to centuries old grievances would not support him no matter what - they would rather perish... But it was actually a good thing - as they also had enemies. And so messengers were sent to reluctant clans - with bribes, promises of great wealth and power that trade will bring, favourable sentences issued by a princess, that favoured more complacent clans over hardliners... And where it did not help, all kinds of help for the pretenders was provided to challenge old leaders and depose them. It did not take long before resistance to planned reforms melted like snow during a sunny spring day. Clans supported Euan - and if he leads them to victory, it will be enough to cement his position... If not, well..."

We will no longer wait for inevitable idly - we will prepare for war, and start it on our own terms.\nBut there is an issue of how to act. Though a large part of warchiefs suggestions are worthless, we actually got from them a few interesting ideas. First, we could simply fortify and provoke Skynavians to attack our forts - bleeding them out in the process. However due to the sheer length of the border it may be problematic to protect it - so perhaps a more offensive approach should be taken. We can try to sneak a few warbands across the border and order them to harass Skynavian supply lines and wreck as much havoc as possible.

Many of our tribesponies have some legitimate ire towards Skynavians and over twenty years of war caused lots of destruction and suffering. Most of Skynavian leadership have however perished in battles or escape to fight for communist cause in some distant lands (and hopefully we will never see them again). It would force us to punish some low-level officers and more-less random griffon soldiers and surely put a strain on future relations with griffons. It might be better idea to forgive Skynavians - and punish only those who are actually guilty of direct harmful actions against civilian population - though many clans will be against it, such an act of forgiveness might be a good fresh start - and with enough of equestrian-like talking about friendship even most obstinate ponies will perhaps one day start to believe that coexistence is indeed possible."

With reconquest of the west, exiled clans wish to return to their ancestral lands... However large swathes of it are now occupied by its new griffon inhabitants and used for mining, forestry or farming... It is obvious that griffons are not pleased with being forced to move away and to be honest... They do quite a good job with taming these previously wild wastelands of nearly zero value - now filled with communal farms or thriving industry. While tempting to let griffons keep the land, we cannot really do this - backslash would be immense and Euan would probably see his head on the pike in the worst case. Forcing griffons to move away from these lands is the simplest solution, but we will not benefit from it in long term - perhaps however we can convince both sides for some sort of arrangement, where both would share the same land and griffons would pay for right to use it to the rightful pony owners... Afterall, money can solve any conflict."

Euan Stormshield and his various aides occupied more and more halls and rooms - and nascent bureaucracy seemed to grow nearly every day. Things were going rather smoothly, Skynavians were eager to cooperate and despite complaints from some, Euan invited many of them to help him with governing a reunited Tìr Deighe. Malcontents were silenced by his recent successes and his control was nearly absolute. Fiana, always shy and timid, rarely opposed his actions and if she tried to, he was always able to make her leave through lengthy tirades about the necessity of changes and previous successes. To be fair she was a kindhearted pony, but lacked a resoluteness a leader should possess - and apparently felt better in a role of symbol, waving to her subjects during parades. Perhaps griffon republicans were indeed right - and days of monarchy were long gone...\nNevertheless Euan found Fiana useful, and even though more radical of his new skynavian advisors suggested some more radical actions - he knew that having such a unifying symbol is very useful.\nBut even with his usual hyperactivity he could not be everywhere - he needed to delegate tasks - and could not even though it would simplify so many issues, rule alone. He needed support from both ponies and griffons if he wanted to achieve his dreams. With clans weaker than ever he could finally create a centralized government, where merits, not origin would matter - or listen to Skynavians and reform the Council to represent not tribes - but creatures itself, with more fair, and democratic representation - in this way hopefully in future mending the divisions between clans once and for all."

Due to the nearly non-existent nature of our ‘government’, until now there was not really a need for a well organized tax policy and we were able to rely on gifts and tributes from various clans.

Hailing from one of smaller clans, which was nearly wiped out many years ago by griffon raiders of Sunstriker, Gordon continued to fight griffon menace on every opportunity - vedinian knights looking for “glory”, raiders from the south, and Skynavians... He fought them all. Even when he lost his eyes a few years ago, when he miraculously survived a nearly direct hit by an artillery shell, he insisted to be let to continue fighting - and even though he was not very useful in a field, his experience was invaluable. Most chieftains respected him, and the princess believed that gaining his help may be the best way to force the unruly chiefs of various warbands to fight together, not just compete for glory. And now she sat vis-a-vis him, and wasn’t really sure what to say. Old pony was polite, yet even without eyes to look into... Fiana could feel that he did not treat her seriously - for him, the princess was clearly just an inexperienced child, playing a leader.\n“It’s not like I do not appreciate the invitation, princess, but I’m a busy pony. You know, when you are old, each day counts, as there are few of them left...”  Out of nowhere, said Gordon. “What is exactly the purpose of this meeting?”\n“I want to ask you for your help. Our warriors need one leader, but chieftains do not listen... But you are well respected by most of them, no matter the clan allegiances.”\n“And this leader I guess would be you?” Said Gordon, clearly not waiting for an answer. “You might be a princess, a symbol of unity of clans, but you have no experience in leading the warriors. It would do more bad than good. Just keep smiling at leaders of the clans during councils and all will be fine. Let the grown ups deal with war.”\n“Yes, I might have no experience.” Replied a princess, trying to keep composure “But even I see, constant bickering just hinders us. Yes, I might have no experience, but unlike stubborn old fools who lead our warriors I at least want to learn and listen to others. I simply ask you for help, because it's a faster way than meeting with every single chieftain with his delusions of grandeur. But I will not be offended in my own home. Role of the princess is to lead her people not to just “smile”. And I’m going to fulfill my duties.”\n“You have guts, girl.” Laughed Gordon. “You indeed are a Snowflake, you all may seem nice and quiet, but you are warriors deep in your hearts... I will help you, princess. Just try to listen to the advice, like you said you will. We have to many hot-blooded youngsters now, when we need calm and tactics”"

Though it lacked the precision of modern military maps the princess saw a few times in her life, it was nevertheless a useful tool and helped to easily explain one's plans. Today the princess invited a few more experienced chieftains and clan leaders to discuss the ongoing war.\n“The truth is princess.” Sighed Gordon, also known as the Archer. “That we are losing. Even the blind sees it.” Few laughed hearing this joke. Though Gordon was not really able to properly command warriors in a field considering loss of his eyes during one of battles with griffons, he was nevertheless an experienced leader - and widely respected among warriors. “If we continue fighting as before, well... It won’t end well. Every day more of these crazed communists arrive in Skynavia to fight for their cause, and they simply have bigger, better guns.”\n“There is another thing.” Added Euan Stormshield, most recent, though still not very enthusiastic addition to princess war council. “That some of my ponies caught Skynavian spies. They were meant to sow dissent and cause an uprising. What is worse, some ponies listen to them.”\n“Only because you kept talking about all these subversive ideas.” Snarked Gordon.\n“Please, let’s not argue.” Sighed Fiana. “We do not need another argument. We need solutions. That’s why I called you all here. I know it’s not good, but there must be something that might be done.”\n“Just fighting them in small skirmishes is pointless.” Said Euan. “We need to strike, and do it before the Skynavians do.”\n“I agree with young Stormshield.” Added Gordon. “We know this land better than they do. We can send some scouts to prepare routes for our warriors.”\n“What about our defences?” The princess asked.\n“Well, we can expand some forts and hope they hold.” Continued Archer. “But it will take some effort, and we won't have much time and ponies.”\n“About ponies.” Smiled Euan. “There might be some solution. “I made contact with some smugglers, who reached the ponies who remained in the west. Their warriors are ready and willing to join us. But we need to decide quickly, otherwise the Skynavians will be here first.”"

Yet, he convinced many ponies to his vision, and even now without his support it would be difficult to lead the tribes. Luckily, Stormshields were not just warriors - but also merchants, and as such they were much less stubborn than many other ponies. Now, he invited the princess to present his newest purchase - a cannon, brought straight from Riverlands. Few of his tribesponies, assisted by a Moltenrock unicorn were busy preparing it, while Euan kept talking about new, fascinating prospects of cooperation with the East.\n “And it is not the only thing we can get from them, princess! Weapons, electronics, new farming and mining equipment... We need it all. I think they are ready!” After a moment, with a loud, thunderous sound a cannon fired, turning nearby rock formation into a dusty mess. \n “I must admit, it is quite impressive.” Fiana used this opportunity to finally say something. “But what about other clans? They do not want to abandon the ways of their forefathers in favour of pretending to be griffons.”\n “It is natural to fear change.” Responded Euan. “And though I’m not pleased with it, I’m aware that other clans may not be as... receptive as mine. But I believe that we need to change if we want to survive.”\n “But we cannot forget who we are.”\n “That’s a fair point, princess, but perhaps in the future... Well, that’s not a conversation for today I guess. For now I’m pleased with the current deal. Moltenrocks are more than happy to experiment with weapons like one I just showed you, and I promise that results will be even more impressive...” Euan went back to his monologue.

Yet, the city remained lively and vibrant. Even now, with pony warriors guarding the streets, griffons crowded it, dealing with their everyday issues, many of them not bothered by what happened and even trying to be friendly towards ponies. Yet, many older griffons who were not born here, and partook in conquest of this land, were clearly on the verge of getting into open fight with “reactionary occupiers”. Luckily there were not that many of them, otherwise the situation might quickly escalate into violence.\nOnce princesses have arrived, multiple griffons have requested an audience - most of them were quite polite, not savage brutes depicted in stories by warriors - and they all talked about the future and peace. They were tired of war, which lasted for twenty long years - many of them were born here or arrived as children - and their leaders were mostly dead, or already fled Skynavia. They hoped for rapprochement and a new start. However in the east, many were vengeful, and wanted payback. They said that there can never be peace between griffons and ponies, and that griffons must get back south - and if they will not want to, they need to be forced.\nIt was up to the princess to make a decision - one that will surely shape the north in the years to come."

Some Skynavians tried to explain it to us, but it only made our head hurt. Like seriously... Hive mind communism? What does it mean? They eat bees? And it is supposed to be a serious thing, and there is a group practicing it somewhere in the woods. No matter what they call themselves, these groups mostly refuse to submit to us - luckily they wish to be left alone and we can probably just let them be... Issue is, many of them occupy the land that belonged to ponies - and our clansponies are not happy with being evicted from their homes by some squatters - and not being able to return.

After years of hard work, Fiana found herself one day... lacking anything even remotely important to do. There was no single dispute among clans, none of her subordinates asked for orders... Peace and quiet. It was in fact... a bit unnerving! She roamed a palace for some time, distracting servants until finally decided to rest a bit in one of the greenhouse gardens. Gardens of Snowflake Palace were one of its many wonders - merchants brought many exotic and beautiful plants from the south, which were cultivated here - both thanks to pony magic and mastery of craftsmen who built these structures. When she was a filly, Fiana liked to play in these gardens, imagining she had adventures in mysterious southern lands, trekking through vast jungles and exploring lost temples, as she read in one of the books found in the palace library. Those were better, simpler days... Fiana sat on one of the benches, simply enjoying the smell of blooming flowers.\nWas it how her life was going to be now? Quiet, nearly identical days - with the old way triumphant, few will change in the North, and with bonds between clans stronger than ever, even once a tedious task of dealing with their disputes wasn’t really that occupying any longer.\nYes...

Fight that ensued was long and brutal - Stormshields were aware they would be given no pardon. Though they repelled a few initial assaults, undead warriors kept attacking day and night, giving Stormshields no time to rest. After a few days, when defenders were utterly exhausted, time for the final strike came. However, to archdruid irritation, many of the ponies which had gathered in Frostbell left the city before or during the siege - either heading towards lands of Arcturians or by ships, towards the East. Euan Stormshield himself also fled - the coward did not even have enough courage to fight for his cause like all those he left behind. Most of those were however either too young or old to fight, and the majority of warriors have been slain - therefore reformer clans should not pose any threat to us in the future. After short deliberation Archdruid decided not to pursue them - clan Stormshield have been broken, and all its members have died or fled - with this, the reformer cause is lost and there is no need for further bloodshed.

There was a reason why druids avoided them - they were often twisted and vengeful. And always wanted something in return when asked for help. It could be said they were much more... focused than in life - lost souls obsessed by past failures, that could not find peace, or spirits who thirsted for a long lost power and life - and soon this desire became what determined them. The longer they were stuck between life and death, the more they desired to experience once again what they have lost.\nEver since he made a pact with Blizzard Kings, Gavin could feel their presence - they were always watching, always whispering... For a long time they were deprived of life, until they became just a shade of ponies they just were - all that was left was thirst for vengeance on those who wronged them, and desire for power... and life. But they still had their knowledge - about magic long forgotten - knowledge they would share with the archdruid. But what he wanted to achieve was impossible for any druid or sorcerer in the northern lands - not even Blizzard Kings unleashed that kind of power - and it would require sacrificing tens of thousands lives - without guarantee to succeed. There was a way however - one life to save the entire nation.\nMembers of the clan Snowflake were blessed by all northern spirits - a unique trait, they owed to the founder of the royal dynasty - and which could be used during a ritual meant to destroy Skynavia - and eradication of the bloodline founded by one who defeated them would please the Blizzard Kinds.\nFor Gavin it was a fair price - one life for salvation of his kinsmen."

Though ponies are in general magical creatures, the northern ones were highly reliant on their deities - and very often the natural talents of the ponies are not enough to survive in this harsh land. While the crops die, weather becomes more and more erratic and clans start to fight each other, many elders and druids start to question if they made the right choice...\nThen, unexpectedly all the druids were invited to Everfrost, where they were promised to get a salvation for their tribesponies. They could witness the powers which those who were following archdruid Gavin harnessed, unaffected by the punishment of the Spirits - and were offered a... solution.

Now however, North had a new ruler, a new tyrant, who ruled it with an iron hoof. War with Skynavia changed northern ponies - more than anyone had thought - and there was not much needed to reveal what they became. Gone were days of peace and harmony.

In dozens of the holy woods, springs and places of magic, followers of the Frost King have performed their dark magic, sacrificing hundreds of griffon prisoners to open the way into the realm of spirits, and make them... vulnerable.\nAs northern spirits were dying, stripped of their magic, Frost King power only grew. He became the living god - one able to rival alicorns - and the one who will bring eternal slavery to the griffons - and reward the faithful handsomely.

Streets were covered with bodies of the dead, and inside the buildings, those who clenched to life longest, could be found in frozen piles of bodies - hugging each other, in vain hope of finding a bit of warmth.\n When the pony scouts reached the city they found no one alive - the New Skynavia was no more, the dream of equality and socialism had died with it.

Any trace of life fades away from the eyes of a princess, yet the heart keeps beating...\nFinally after a few seconds that seemed to last an eternity, with the last beat of the heart, the ritual is complete. The spirits of the North are being robbed of their powers, as the blizzard forms over Skynavia - and their tie to the ponies is being severed. With the death of the last of the Snowflake in sacrilegious ritual ends the communion of the ponies with their deities - the druids across the Tìr Deighe feel what could be described only as lose of the part of their soul - as having the strongest connection with spirits, they are the most affected.\nAs those who have perished during the ritual turn into dust, the archdruid looks one last time on the body of Fiana. Voices in his head howl in joy - their vengeance upon Cainnech Snowflake fulfilled, their thirst for power sated."

Even the griffons instinctively cringe, as they can sense the upcoming danger. The sky goes dark, and clouds cover the sun. Whatever animals are in Skynavia, they run in amok, trying to escape from the doomed city. It’s getting colder and colder... In just a few minutes temperature drops tens of degrees, while the wind picks up. Not even the fire and shelter help, as temperature keeps going lower and lower - and soon even the metal starts cracking and breaking. The doom is approaching the city with an unnatural blizzard. It would last for days, as buildings were covered in snow and ice - one that kept... expanding, covering everything in the city. Not even the fire, magical or natural, could stop it, and each one who tried to leave a safe shelter died in just a few seconds, as their lungs turned into ice. But not even the buildings offered refuge - they just prolonged the agony of the Skynavians.\n Some prayed to the gods, hoping for salvation - but gods turned their back on them.\nFew of the most brave one tried to escape the doomed city - the trails to it were covered in bodies, as more and more of them were falling, unable to push forward.\nOthers have chosen quick death by guns - preferable to slowly freezing to death.\n When the blizzard passed, Skynavia was no more. Streets were covered with bodies of the dead, and inside the buildings, those who clenched to life longest, could be found in frozen piles of bodies - hugging each other, in vain hope of finding a bit of warmth.\n When the pony scouts reached the city they found no one alive - the New Skynavia was no more, the dream of equality and socialism had died with it. The streets were quiet - and the city was still covered in ice and snow that did not melt - and would never melt.\nSkynavia would forever remain the frozen tomb - and not even the spirits of its inhabitants would be able to leave the fallen city."

It was much, much worse for him - he could sense all these souls, their anger, fear and pain... But he had to be here - he had to witness the result of his actions - it was the right thing to do - it was his duty to carry this burden. Hundreds of thousands must have perished here, and Skynavia will be forever tainted by dark magic...\nAs Gavin continued to walk the streets, the pressure kept growing and growing. Ghosts could feel the living and flocked to them, like a moth to the fire. Archdruid could no longer handle this - all he wanted was to retreat deep into himself and cut himself off the souls he had cursed for eternity...\nBut there was no respite - he longer felt the presence of the Spirits, ever since he carved out his own heart, to replace it with a block of ice, no more reassuring presence. Now there were only voices of the long dead, vengeful tyrants from the past, whispering about revenge, power and control. There was nowhere to run - but the archdruid would not fall without a fight. \nArchdruid collapsed on the ground, seemingly lifeless - but as his companions gathered around, unsure what to do, he suddenly opened his eyes. There were no longer Kings of Blizzard, and there was no longer Gavin the Frost Beard - a new entity rose - gone were the regrets, but something of an old archdruid remained - a desire to protect his kin, the ponies he tried to lead for many decades - and who would claim the place they truly deserved - to no longer live in fear, but to rule over the Griffonia.

Locals, if not escaped before the battle, most likely shared the fate of the fallen soldiers - and the only trace of their existence were burned down remnants of nearby villages. The sun was already setting when a small group of griffons traversed the outskirts of the battlefield. Most of them covered in dirt and wounded - a pitiful state for proud knights of the Silberkralle Order. They had to move fast - though hopefully, the pursuers lost the trace already, it was not a safe place. In the distance they could see some barely visible figures - perhaps those were just robbers or scavengers. But it could be much worse - an undead monster raised by dark magic, or one of the monsters that seemed to appear out of nowhere recently - as if the war has awakened horror that all thoughts are long gone.\nGrandmaster Hector stopped for a brief moment - they did not have time to bury even part of the dead - and the only thing he could do was to pray shortly for the peaceful rest of those who had perished. Now they had to move - south, towards the forests, where they could find a refuge, regroup and prepare."

Nevertheless, Grimclaw's group quickly traversed the Herzland and entered the Cloudbury - here things started to complicate. Ponies had time to solidify their rule here - and locals knew the price for insubordination. First mistake Erik made was to stop in a small village, hoping for a bit of rest and getting some supplies. Though the locals were poor, they seemed welcoming and generous... Only to send an envoy to a nearby garrison, denouncing the knights. If not caution, that made Grimclaw set up a sentry, they would be slaughtered - and yet, the ensuing fight took lives of the half of Argentumdämmerung knights who followed him north. Among the burning village, knights dragged the village leader - an older griffon, who sobbed and begged for mercy - they had no choice, he said - if ponies found out, they would all be killed, or sent to the mines. And in reward their burdens would be lowered, and they would have more food to survive the winter. In the midst of these pathetic excuses something cracked in Erik - he grabbed his sword and decapitated a traitor.\n“Kill them all and take all the food.” He ordered his men. “They deserve no mercy.

Gerhard could only hope his mentor got a quick death - and that he would find peace in Boreas golden gardens. Now, he hid in bushes, several hundred meters away, watching northern barbarians put a temple on fire. They already took all the items that seemed valuable to them - and some of them were arguing among themselves for their part of loot. A small fight occurred, when two particularly hot-blooded ponies could not agree which one will take a particular ornamental book - however their leader cut it short - literally, by cutting a book in half - ponies quickly ripped the insides and stuffed the cover into their bags. After an hour or two, when the building was burning down, the warband left it, heading further south. It took another hour before Gerhard mustered his courage to leave the bushes. He headed towards a place he called home for so long - and tried to pick up whatever remained from the holy books and symbols scattered among the mud...\nAll across the conquered griffon lands a royal edict is announced and reinforced - all forms of worship of the griffon gods are forbidden and the only god griffons can and ought to worship is the Frost King - the one who punished their wickedness and weakness and the one who shall rule them for eternity. Pony warriors are assaulting the temples, desecrating them and burning them to the ground - in a final show of superiority over defeated griffons. As once ponies have bested their own weak deities, now they shall do so with griffon ones.\nSuch acts of course met with nearly immediate response - our warriors have to disperse numerous griffon rebels, who are trying to protect their places of worship - and all across the Griffonia, when news about our actions arrive, the priesthood calls for holy war. However, as divided as they are, griffons are unlikely to unify in their resistance and we should be able to proceed with orders given by Frost King."

The group stopped, yet Erik, after a brief examination of the fallens state, just said.\n“Take his supplies and leave him.

We are entering the heart of darkness, to save the entire Griffonia.” Responded Grimclaw.\n“At least we should leave him some food, he can catch up with us!”\n“Don’t you see? He is already dead, and supplies will be more useful for the rest.”\nGroup quietly took all the useful things their fallen comrade was carrying - and without a word left him to his own fate.

Noble mansions were pillaged, temples razed to the ground , and monuments shattered. However, when ponies assaulted the Grand Temple of Boreas, the population of the city, which they thought was beaten into submission, rose - thousands took up arms and fought back - with the entire city soon falling into anarchy. The fires ignited by ponies came out of control, consuming entire districts - with no one to quell them. Perhaps for the first time, both revolunatiories and imperial loyalists who stayed in the city fought side by side - against the foreigners who seeked to destroy the heart of Griffonia. Brutal infighting took three days - after which the pony warriors largely retreated from a ruined city, leaving it in claws of battered rebels.

And now history repeated itself - as Herzlands were occupied by foreign invaders, many griffons found a refugee in Scheisswald - and many of them were more than willing to fight back.\nA small cabin, located in the midst of woods - once a bandit refuge, was filled with griffons. Former imperial officers, rebels once fighting alongside Bluhm, few priests and knights of defeated orders... It took a lot of effort to gather them all here - and prevent this gathering from turning into slaughter over old grievances. Still, most of the griffons kept to their own groups, looking suspiciously on others.\n“Brothers and Sisters... Friends.” Hector started the meeting. “I’m grateful you all agreed to arrive and put aside our differences...”\n“Let’s not be that haste.” Interrupted a griffon in reichsamree captain’s uniform.\n“Put aside our differences and cooperate,,,” Hector nevertheless continued.\n“You can see how *they* are willing to cooperate.” Snarked a griffon wearing a red bandana. \n“Cooperating with you would be treason...” Responded imperial officer, yet Hector stopped a brewing argument by hitting a table with his fist.\n“Quiet everyone! This is exactly why we are here, and our homes are burning. We just keep bickering, while ponies are pillaging cities and murdering thousands. Yes, we were enemies. But now we are all in this together. If we continue fighting, there will never be a hope for Herzland. You have seen what this Frost King and his monsters do. Armies of undead, dark magic... You might have heard stories from refugees, about slavery, opression and tyranny they established in a North. When we stayed here, Griffenheim burned. And you know what? It’s denizens fought together. They did not argue, they fought and they pushed the invaders out of the city. Yet if we do nothing, ponies will return and this time finish the job. Griffenheim will fall and reign of terror will continue. We MUST unite. Divided we can only die, united we can win. Our enemy is vulnerable, overstretched. It is time to strike, and if we coordinate our effort we can liberate the Herzland. Together.”\nThere was a long moment of silence, when Hector stopped talking.

Only half a dozen of Argentumdämmerung knights remained - and they no longer resembled proud griffon warriors - all of them were wounded and covered in dirt, weakened by diseases and hunger. Yet they pushed forward - towards “the seat of darkness” in Everfrost. Erik felt, however, that his companions had long ago lost faith in the success of their mission - and his leadership. Whenever he was close, conversations were cut short. The sun was setting - it was time to move. \n“We need to resume marching. We are close.” Said Grandmaster and rose from the floor. None of his companions followed. After a brief moment of silence one of them said quietly.\n“You repeat it every day. Every day *we are close*. And what? Everfrost is nowhere to be seen, and more of us just keep dying and dying. We should have stayed in Katerin Erik, and fought for its griffons, not go on this mad quest.”\n“Doing so would be pointless. We need to strike evil directly and kill this self proclaimed god. Now move, there is no time for pointless discussions.” Responded Erik.\n“Screw you!” Responded knight. “I’m going back home. Your madness consumed enough good griffons, and I’m not going to be its next victim” Griffon moved towards the exit. \n“I will not tolerate treason!” Half saif, half screamed Grimclaw and drew his sword. “You all swore fealty to me, and have to obey MY orders!” In response, the knight drew his own weapon.\n“I reject your authority Erik, you destroyed Argentumdämmerung and all we believed in. You ordered us to slaughter villagers, to steal from them, to abandon our own comrades. You do not deserve to lead us!” \nWith a wild scream, Erik charged. Fueled by rage, he was quick - too quick for a weakened knight he attacked. Even though the first attack was enough to kill his target, Erik continued to stab and slash body for a long time. Finally however, when he came back to senses he realised he was alone - all the others ran away during a fight."

The city was rather empty - though not touched by atrocities of war, it was quite obvious that many of its denizens marched south, joining Frost King army - and never a very populous city was disturbingly... quiet. Luckily, locals were more busy with their own problems - and as long as Erik avoided the marketplaces or taverns, he was safe. \nGuards of the palace did not really pay much attention - probability of an enemy being able to get so far North was truly miniscule - and besides - how could a mere mortal kill a god? Erik quickly climbed the walls and glided on the other side - soon he was inside of the vast structure. Inside the palace, once decorated with ornate reliefs and paintings depicting the history of northern ponies, were now covered in snow and ice - often forming weird and... unnatural shapes. There was no one inside - and Erik traversed the corridors hearing only the sound of his steps. He was here for the first time - yet somehow he knew where he should head. \nFrost King occupied an old Hall of Gatherings - now turned into his throne room. Undead guards stepped aside as Erik entered the room, granting him passage. The Frost King himself sat on his throne - elderly pony. so frail in comparison to the grandiose of the hall - yet even Erik could feel a power vibrating from him. \n“Welcome, Erik Grimclaw, grandmaster of the fallen order. I was waiting for you.” Said pony.\n“Waiting? You know I’ll come?” \n“Yes, of course I did. Here, in my domain, few things escape my sight. I must say I’m... impressed. You exceeded any expectations I had.” Frost King smiled slightly. “Griffons are such weak and miserable beings, so inferior and worthless... And yet you rose beyond the limits of your race.”\n“Miserable?” Said Erik quietly. “Weak? And yet I stand here, and I will be the one to destroy you and free the griffons from your tyranny.”\n“You can try to do it. But... Are the griffons really worthy to be free? Your companions failed you, cowards and weaklings. They were supposed to be the best of the best. And yet they failed. Time after time griffons fail, fight among each other and bicker. I took the few, the ponies of the North, those you laughed at. And yet they conquered the City of Emperors! They proved to be strong, and now they will rule the griffons in my name. The weak do not deserve mercy or freedom. They exist only to be ruled. And I deem you worthy. Join me, and you shall be elevated among the worthless griffon kind to be one of my chosen champions. You will wield powers unimaginable to you, and you shall be among the rulers of griffonkind.\nErik Grimclaw drew his sword..."

And so they did - city after city, village after village, armies pushed south, leaving behind them a trail of destruction. It was only a matter of time before resistance would be broken, and griffons firmly put under the hoof of northern invaders. \nErik faintly remembered this place, a small town in Katerin. He must have visited it in the past - not that it really mattered. It was just yet another place to be pacified, before combination of undead, pony warriors and few, clawpicked by him griffon renegades would march forward. This time it seemed to be quick work - skirmishers who arrived a few hours before seemed to have already finished off the defenders, as the approaching group was welcomed with silence - not with gunshots. However... it was too quiet, and soldiers were nowhere to be seen - the number of bodies was also surprisingly small - as if locals escaped before. An ambush? As the group marched deeper into the town, they found some dead griffons, and ponies, but except for scavenger birds, the place was seemingly deserted. Finally, they reached the town square. The place was covered with bodies - both griffon in old imperial uniforms or knightly armours and pony warriors. There was only one creature left here alive - an old, armored griffon, leaning against the wall, standing in slowly growing pool of blood dripping from beneath the armor. Seeing the approaching group, said griffon spat on the ground. \n“Grimclaw. I hoped you were dead, that these rumors about you leading the army of the dead are just some horrible, made up story. Tell me... Why? Why did you betrayed griffonkind, gods and your brothers in arms? I always knew you were a power hungry bastard, but I hoped you were still a better griffon.”\n“Griffons deserve only to be crushed Hector, to be punished for their weakness.” Erik shrugged his arms. “We were all just deluding ourselves, thinking griffons might have a better future, that there is some divine plan for us. And even if it was, we clearly failed. It will just continue, endlessly, the same thing, griffons fighting griffons... And nothing comes out of it. Just more and more fools in power, fighting for scraps. Even as the blizzard came from the north, griffons just fought each other. Cowards, fools and traitors.”\n“You are mad. I do not know what happened to you, but you are now just a pathetic, mad shell. You are a fool, deluding yourself that the griffon spirit can be crushed. You are a coward, for siding with these monstrosities. And you are a traitor of all the griffons.”\n“This conversation bored me already.” Angry voice tone clearly contrasted with words. “Tell me, where are the rest of the rebels, and be so kind as to die without any further delays.”\n“There are none. I’m just the last here standing... Ah, you mean the locals? They escaped long before, we were just meant to delay your butchers, so they could get away from here. No more blood for you today.” Hearing this Erik raised his claw, giving sign to his bodyguards, who reached for guns. \n“Now, I guess you will just order to shoot me?” Ardennson mocked Erik. “The great champion of death, fearing to fight a lone, wounded, old griffon?” \nHearing this Erik grinned angrily and grabbed a sword. Not even trying to contain his anger, he charged forward, screaming. What happened was not really a fight - more of an execution, with Hector barely being able to raise his sword. With a single, powerful hit, Grimclaw decapitated the old knight. For a few seconds he stood over the headless corpse, breathing heavily. When he turned around, his companions - these who were not undead - flinched, seeing his maniacal expression."

ntribes.65.d:0 "Last few months have been nothing but a one, blood filled nightmare. Ever since savage armies of northern barbarians came here, aided by undead monsters and dark monsters, Aquileia has been slowly turning into one giant graveyard. Cities were pillaged, villages destroyed if invaders faced even slightest resistance, temples burned to the ground. Yet the worst was yet to come. Although even before particularly rabid warriors tended to target local ponies, almost out of nowhere came the order - kill them all. Kill every pony in Aquileia, every one of them. Silver Tail was lucky to have escaped a few hours before warriors arrived in his town. First time they arrived, they sacked his shop, and beat him until he passed out. Yet, even from his hideout in nearby forest he could hear the screams of the murdered - unable to do anything. All he could do was to run away. He traveled mostly by night, hoping to not get caught. \nYet, after days of fear and hunger he finally lost his caution and walked directly into a trap. Three masked and armed griffons were well hidden among trees and appeared out of nowhere. Silver Tail heard about griffon traitors, who sometimes assisted invaders. Resigned before the point of being willing to pose any resistance, the pony just waited for a shot... that never came.\n“He doesn’t look like a stray scout.” Said one of the griffons, which as Silver Tail notices was wearing remnants of aquileian army uniform. “We’re lucky, we did not listen to you.” He said to other partisan. “And did not shoot this one. What will be next Guillame, will you mistake a cow for a tank? This one has zero weapons, no weird armor and bone trinkets, every one of these maniacs have”\n“Better question is, what will we do with him?” Responded griffon called Guillame. “We can’t just leave him here, there are entire squads around seeking for someone to kill. And the nearest staging point for refugees is far away.”\n“We can’t leave him here, it's a death sentence. Hey you, do not stand here like a stone statue. You’re going with us!”\n“But... where?” Silver Tail finally managed to stutter some words. “They are everywhere...They will kill me, kill you... There is nowhere to run.”\n“Heh, you’ll be surprised. It will be a long road, but we’ll get you out of here. There are smugglers on a coast, helping ones like you get beyond sea. It will take a few weeks, but we’ll get there for sure. You are not the first pony we managed to get there. Now, we need to go!”"

Apparently after conquering the region armies of the Frost King have started to commit a brutal (even by their standards) genocide against local pony population, claiming they are “tainted by griffons”. Every pony in Aquileia is ordered to be killed on sight. While the army of the Tyranny continues its purges, thousands of survivors have arrived in New Mareland, mostly thanks to the help of the griffon smugglers. It is our duty to help these poor ponies and we cannot turn our back to their plight. While we are not yet under direct attack of the Frost King armies we surely should start to prepare for invasion - which is becoming more and more likely with every day."

ntribes.67.d:0 "City of Griffonstone, the Holy Griffonstone, the First City - a place known by many names. At first it seemed that Frost King armies for some reason decided to spare this venerable metropolis. Armies stopped, and beyond some magical bombardments, meant to eliminate pockets of soldiers trying to counter attack, ponies seemed to be content with just surrounding and isolating the Griffonstone. Although many griffons escaped into the mountains, the city was still filled with both locals and many refugees who hoped that gods would surely protect them from the invader. \nErik Grimclaw observed the unfolding ‘spectacle’ from one of the advanced positions. He was sent here per order of the Frost King to ‘oversee’ the destruction of the city, although when he arrived most preparations were already done by acolytes present on site. Now it has begun. Entire batteries of artillery started firing the incendiary shells, while hundreds of mages started to unleash all the magical power they could harness. Bolts of energy and bursts of magical flames followed more conventional ammunition towards the base of the ancient tree. City was engulfed in flames, and quickly turned into a giant torch. Even from a distance Erik could see hundreds of griffons who survived the initial bombardment and tried to escape from the doomed city - truly unlucky ones - most of them died a horrific death, as another and another waves of spells killed everyone who got in their distance. Yet despite the apocalyptic power of artillery and sorcerers, the tree still stood, as if in a final act of defiance. As if in a bloody frenzy, perhaps feeling anger of their master, mages continued to unleash all the power they could. But something was wrong... Even Erik could feel it - there was something incoming, and he could nearly feel the air vibrating not just from temperature. Suddenly with a loud crack, the tree broke in half, with its upper part collapsing into an endless abyss below. Moment later earth started to shake - and all the northern mages started to scream in terror, feeling the incoming magical cataclysm. Powers they have used were now turning against them - they were devoured alive by unnatural flames or ripped apart by explosions of magical energy. In a few moments army camp turned into complete chaos, as entire squads were annihilated by both an earthquake and chaotic magic. Erik survived only thanks to his distant location - away from the rest of the army, his position was spared from the worst. Yet even he could only cover in terror, hoping it will soon end... And in deep of his heart, hoping the cataclysm will kill him too. After a few horrific moments it all suddenly ended. All that was left were miserable remnants of once powerful army and burning remnants of the Griffonstone. \nErik just stood there without a word, looking as the tree continued to burn down. He wanted to feel something. Anything. But this time..."

Vast armies continued their oppression of the population and sacking the land for its riches. And so, Erik Grimclaw found himself in gryphusian mountains - one of the last places to be conquered. For years now, he had just marched forward, from one battle to another, having nothing else in his ‘life’ than this endless bloodshed, hoping to forget... And maybe hoping someone would finally slay him in combat? He was not so lucky, and continued to live this wretched existence. It seemed Frost King lost interest in his servant a long time ago - and so he was left here stranded, with just a few of his renegades, who like him had nowhere else to go. Griffons he hated even more than he despised himself. It was truly over. Griffons were defeated, and their future was one of subservience to the mad God of the North, being subject to suffering on his whims. And he had his part in this, leading Frost King armies. Truly it was the most fitting penalty. Being forgotten, discarded like a broken tool.\nAll Erik did these days was just gazing into a distant horizon, and reminscenting about the past. There was nothing else left to him, he was a griffon who deserved no future, and wouldn’t have any. Not much different from undead monsters he used to command - feeling nothing, just following orders of their dark master... And now there was truly nothing left. \nIt was a day not different from others before. His remaining subordinates got used to their commander's ‘routine’, being themselves more busy extorting food from locals, using their power as pawns of the northern tyrant. It was only when Grimclaw did not return late in the evening to their camp, few of them decided to check the place where he usually sat for a whole day. All that was left was his sword - discarded in the grass. Grimclaw was nowhere to be seen - and frankly - none of them really cared. While in next years few would rather report a white haired griffon in rags being seen in nearby mountains and forests - for a few moments, before he escaped, trying to avoid any contact with other living beings, his existence became in time forgotten - his life, accomplishments and later betrayal lost to the time..."

It was his ultimate triumph. The rest of the world could only cover in fear and hope, he would not come for them... Maybe one day he will, but for now he was more than enjoying their fear. The revenge was far from done yet - it would never truly be done, as he could continue to torment griffons for eternity. Reign of the Frost King shall last till the end of the time - until the sun will fade, and there will be nothing but ice and darkness.\nAnd yet, from time to time, listening to the reports of his acolytes and warlords, Frost King felt annoyed. It seemed that griffons never knew when to give up. Every now and then there was another uprising, another group of fools trying to oppose his reign. Every time however he sent his servants to crush them - and they succeeded, as they did countless times. And yet, after some time it started anew. At least it kept his servants from becoming completely complacent. And yet, somewhere deep within Frost King a new feeling was born - one he had not felt until now..."

While the grasp of invaders over this land was weaker than a few years before, they were still quite dangerous - and as their control dwindled, ponies and their undead servants were growing more and more brutal. The place where they met was nothing more than an old basement beneath a ruined quarter of the city - and yet through the years they turned it into one of their many bunkers - storing weapons, preparing emergency exits and setting traps. Locals were unpleasant bunch of bandits and run-away, half crazed slaves - and yet, even these wretched parodies of griffons still held some respect to these who fought against the Tyrant - yet it was never known, when one of them might try to steal the weapons they managed to gather - traps were therefore rather a good idea. \nHere they met to plan their actions - to plan actions of their respective cells. It took some time before disparate groups of partisans started to cooperate - and now yet with every day they grew in numbers. It would be a long time before they could engage invaders more directly - but every day they attacked stragglers and distant outposts, harassed slavers and liberated camps. Every day they continued to fight - some of them have been fighting ever since the War. And yet, no matter their former allegiance - they had the same goal - liberation. Veterans of the old conflicts, scarred reichsarmee soldiers, republicans and those who fought for armies and governments everyone except them forgot about continued to lead - and teach the new generations, once those who were already born under the yoke of the Winter. They told them about the glorious days of the past. About the armour cladded knights who fought to protect griffonkind, about the opulence and majesty of an fallen empire, about dream of better, unified Griffonia, about gods who still surely watched over their children. And so they fought - even if victory seemed distant. They continued to dream..."

Every step he cursed an idea to come here. He should sit on the bench in front of his house and warm up his bones in the late spring sun, not go on such treks. His grandchildren have long ago pushed forward, chasing each on hilltop - as children do. Childs energy - a thing one can learn to admire, only when breath starts to be short, and weird parts of the body ache in the morning. Nevertheless after a few more steps the old griffon reached the hilltop and sat heavily on the ground. The sight was truly worth a lengthy climb - Lake Rumare looked beautiful this part of the year - blue, clean waters, small farms and vineyards along its shore, separated with small patches of woodland. A sight to behold. In the distance he could see the distant spire of the broken Tower - one of the many that once dominated over lands of Griffon. Now, broken many years ago, with its remnants around a once megalithic structure, it resembled more of a small island. Every time he looked at it, he felt a mixture of fear - of what was once and pride - remembering the day when the tower had fallen. They fought their entire way to it, fighting more and more deranged pony warriors and beasts that not even Maar himself could probably unleash. And yet they pushed forward, knowing that victory was near. The day, when the fortress finally succumbed to artillery fire - even though until the very end sorcerers hiding in it continued to unleash all the power of their spells, finally the Tower had to succumb to the...\n“Grandpaaaaa! She took the shiny rock I found!” Youngest of his children out of nowhere pulled him by arm, and almost screamed to his ear. “I found this rock, and she took it!” \n“Aerm, what?” Old griffon was utterly confused, being pulled out so suddenly out of his memories. “Rock? Can’t you find a new one, there are plenty of nice ones around?” \n“Nooo! This one was mine!” Chick ran towards his sister, which started to run away, triumphantly holding rock in her raised claw.\n“Get back here you little rascals!” Grandfather got up from the ground and followed the young ones - hoping to catch them and make them behave. If their parents could not, it was up to him to ensure the young ones finally stopped fighting about every little thing...\nBehind him, the sun was slowly setting below the tower.

Hordes of tribal warriors, accompanied by undeads and utilising dark magic marched south, conquering many griffon nations, slaughtering all that resisted and enslaving the rest. But this was not the end of the Frost King ambitions, as this being somehow managed to absorb the power of the northern spirits, becoming what can be described only as a demigod, able to rival equestrian alicorns. Probably all the mages in the world could feel the effects of this event - and be horrified by them.

### Leader Descriptions ###
 NTR_GOY_stormshield:0 "Euan Stormshield"
 GOY_stormshield_desc:0 "Since his youth, Euan has been fascinated with the outside world. Growing up in the coastal city of Frostbell, he pestered merchants and sailors, asking them about stories of the foreign lands. It was during that time, when he met Oskar Plumenjar – an exiled heir to the duchy of Cloudbury, who quickly became a friend of Euan – and later, his confidant. Influenced by friendship with Oskar and sailors' stories, Euan realised how much in need of changes was his homeland, and that the only way to win the war with Skynavians was to embrace the ways of griffons – and to outmatch them. Following the death of clan Stormshield's old chieftain, Euan challenged his heir to the traditional duel – and won, becoming the new clan leader. He soon made himself known as a talented diplomat and organiser, leading Stormshield to become the most influential northern clan. Now, being in charge of Tir Deighe itself, Euan is free to introduce the reforms meant to turn these ragged lands into a modern, unified state.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Rich May"
 NTR_gavin:0 "Archdruid Gavin" 
 NTR_gavin_desc:0 "Gavin the Frost Beard, archdruid of the Circle of Ice, was once one of the most respected ponies in the entire Tir Deighe. No one really knows how old he is - and the blessing of Ice made him live much longer than other ponies - far longer than a century, with passing years not dulling his sharp mind. He led the Circle longer than even the oldest ones remember and many asked him for advice - making him one of the most influential ponies in Tir Deighe, rivalling even chieftains of the Great Clans.\n\nNow however, the archdruid has realised that drastic measures must be taken if ponies want to survive griffon onslaught. After descending to the Vault of Broken Swords and making a pact with Kings of Storm, Archdruid was given immense powers - which he intends to use to destroy enemies of the northern ponies. It is a dangerous deal, but Gavin knows that it is the only way to save what he loves most - his kinsponies.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo the Pone"
 NTR_frost_desc:0 "Creature of grief, guilt and vengeance, the Frost King - no longer Gavin the Frots Beard, but not really a Frost King of old. His goal is to protect his pony subjects and claim the position they deserve - as only rulers of Griffonia. His hatred towards Griffons is immense, and his goal is to enslave the entire griffonkind, to make it pay for their crimes against northern ponies. Few know what is the true extent of the Frost King powers, but few doubt he is one of the most powerful sorcerers to ever walk the world. Now, he turns his eyes south - and griffons shall tremble in fear, when undead armies will march to impose a will of their sovereign.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo the Pone"
 NTR_frostking:0 "Frost King"
 NTR_GOY_princessfiana:0 "Princess Fiana II"
 GOY_fiana_desc:0 "Fiana was never meant to be a ruler. Youngest of the children of the previous prince, Fothad III, Fiana was born barely a few years before the skynavian invasion - and when griffons attacked, was just a child. However her older brothers and father have perished during the first years of the war with griffons, leaving Fiana the last of the Snowflake line - and crowned princess in 995. Despite being only fourteen at a time, Fiana tried her best to mediate between increasingly conflicted clans, however was largely unable to solve any of the issues that plagued her realm. Young, inexperienced and not respected by elders and chieftains, she nevertheless tried her best in ruling the nation . She is still being seen as a unifying symbol - a last member of Snowflake clan, the reminder of the past days of peace and harmony. While rather meek and shy, Fiana is determined to save Tir Deighe - and not sacrifice centuries old traditions doing so."

NTR_spirits_blessings_cat_desc:0 "Spirits of the North guide us and bless their chosen tribes since times immemorial. However in these dire days a more direct intervention is needed. Our druids will try to reach directly to spirits and ask for their help - of course we first need to convince druids of the each clan to lend us their help - and channeling the power of the spirits will be an exhausting task - only one blessing may be asked for at a time."

North is the land of spirits and though they have become distant their influence is still felt here - and we can use it for our benefits.

It is more and more difficult to control millions of these pests, and as distance from Everfrost grows, our control weakens. To enforce our rule, series of towers will be constructed - from these, loyal acolytes of the Frost King shall reign over surrounding lands. Through sheer effect of intimidation, powerful fortifactions and spells interwoven into Towers we should be able to establish much firmer control over immediate teritories."
NTR_aurora_tower:0 "Aurora Tower"

NTR_iron_tower:0 "Iron Tower"
