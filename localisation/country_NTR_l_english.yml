NTR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC1:0 "Northern edges of the Griffonia have always been a mysterious place - land of magic and harsh winters. Yet, despite the difficulties, tribes of Tir Deighe have flourished, living in peace with nature and Spirits. Now however, after the invasion of communists from the south, ponies were forced to fight a war they could not easily win. After two decades, the situation has reached a breaking point - reformers call for changes, while much darker forces have arisen to undermine the status quo in the North. Only time will till, if tribes will be able to weather the gathering storm..."

### State Description ###
state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_562:0 "Everfrost"
 state_lore_text_container_state_name_562:0 "The §YCity§! of the §YCrystal Spires§!"
 state_lore_text_container_state_description_562:0 "It is a common belief across the world, that there are no cities in northern §YGriffonia§! - just bunches of shacks and log cabins, scattered along the frozen wasteland. It makes foreigners even more surprised when they visit §CEverfrost§! - capital of §YTir Deighe§! and its largest city. History of Everfrost begins with the unification of the §Ynorthern tribes§! by §CCainnech Snowflake§!. The great mages and craftsponies started to build then a structure, known today as §YSnowflake Palace§!, as a residence of a new king and a place of gatherings of the clans. It is said that the Palace was rather “grown”, than built, using techniques that were later forgotten - and druids managed to shape crystals into seven magnificent spires, that are the highest structures in the city.\n\nAs centuries have passed, the city slowly grew, becoming a main centre of commerce of Tir Deighe. After merchants, craftsponies followed, and when a §Ygreat library§! was created in the halls of Snowflake Palace, many ponies travelled to Evefrost to study knowledge of the previous generations. As a result Everfrost does not resemble any other city in Griffonia - it is a place of art and beauty, with even the smallest buildings being elaborately decorated through generations. Ponies tended to expand their dwellings both on the surface and below it - and one can see how next owners expanded homes they inherited - wanting to match the accomplishments of their ancestors. Of course one cannot forget about the §YGreat Clans§! - each of them, as a matter of honour, erected a large §Yspire-mansion§!, mimicking the royal palace as a show of clan wealth and power.\n\nHowever, years of war with §RSkynavia§! have also affected the Everfrost - though not directly attacked, it was flooded with §Yrefugees§! who now inhabit makeshift districts constructed on the outskirts of the capital. Warbands stop here, before marching to the front, and workshops produce weapons rather than works of art. Peace and harmony of the Everfrost are gone - perhaps forever, yet the city still remains the symbol of pony unity and their ingenuity."

 NTR_plant_ironwood:0 "Plant Ironwood"
 NTR_plant_ironwood_desc:0 "The North is one of a few places in Griffonia where you can still find Ironwood, a rare kind of tree, as durable as steel.

 NTR_clan_stormshield:0 "Clan Stormshield"
 NTR_clan_stormshield_desc:0 "Clan of northern pegasii, the Stormshields, was always known for wanderlust and bravery. Its ponies often ventured outside our borders, either as raiders or merchants, but in times of hardship they were always first to come to defence of the tribes."
 NTR_open_frostbell:0 "Open Frostbell for Trade"

 NTR_limited_contacts:0 "Limited Contacts"
 NTR_limited_contacts_desc:0 "Though we might need them, we should not overly fraternise with the outsiders. Trade with foreign merchants will be limited to a few chosen locations and handled by clan Stormshield, so the rest of us don’t have to be bothered by them."
 NTR_foreign_tech:0 "Foreign Technology"
 NTR_foreign_tech_desc:0 "There is no doubt that if we keep relying solely on our own capabilities we will never be able to rival more developed nations. To that Stormshields offer a simple solution: they can order the necessary research equipment and schematics from foreign merchants."
 NTR_import_planes:0 "Import Airplanes"
 NTR_import_planes_desc:0 "The airplane is truly a fascinating invention, one that makes any pegasus overly excited... we can only guess it’s about speed. We should finally allow them to buy some, so they stop nagging us."

 NTR_profit_desc:0 "Furs, lumber, minerals, products of our artisans... There are lots of sought-after commodities we’ve been selling at a significant discount to attract buyers. Now that we’re relatively well-known in the trading world, we can adjust our prices and start making bank!"
 NTR_royal_academy:0 "The Royal Academy"
 NTR_royal_academy_desc:0 "We received a peculiar request from clan Stormshield. While most of our nation's foals are being educated by druids or while working as apprentices, Stormshields want to establish a proper “university”, where they would educate ponies the way southrons do. Considering they want to self-fund this establishment and are only asking for patronage – why not let them?"
 NTR_strike_enemies:0 "Strike the Enemy"

 NTR_defend_skies:0 "Defend Our Skies"
 NTR_defend_skies_desc:0 "It is likely that our enemies will have a numerically superior air force to ours. Since aggressive airplane use is out of the question, we should focus on intercepting their planes and preventing them from bombing us."

 NTR_healing_herbs_desc:0 "Rarity of herbs with magical qualities severely limits our ability to produce large quantities of medicine.

 NTR_weaponised_magic_desc:0 "Ancient rites of magical enchantment can be applied to modern weaponry all the same as they were used in the olden days. If legendary enchanted swords could bring down lightning, just imagine what an enchanted cannon can do..."

 NTR_spirit_machine_desc:0 "Some metalshapers claim that their patron Spirit is most pleased by the sight of such magnificent creations as tanks – and would gladly accept them as his vessels. How can an enemy hope to defeat our tanks, if they are avatars of a deity?"

 NTR_many_shapes:0 "Many Shapes of Ships"
 NTR_many_shapes_desc:0 "Barkcoat’s shipwrights explained  for hours the differences between various types of ships to us, but nothing stuck to our minds – only that in shipbuilding there are many weird, difficult words.

 NTR_floating_icebergs_desc:0 "It’s weird that no one has thought of this before: smaller icebergs can be enchanted for use as ship hulls. This will let us create warships much faster and make them harder to destroy – after all, it’s not easy to crack a floating mountain of ice! The only issue is ensuring that the iceberg does not melt..."

 NTR_age_of_magic:0 "New Age of Magic"

 NTR_applications_of_ice:0 "The Many Applications of Ice"
 NTR_applications_of_ice_desc:0 "Magical crystals are relatively rare. However one of our mages came up with an idea of enchanting ice, so it could be used as a replacement. Setting up production at scale will require a significant effort, but the results will be worth it."

We just need to ensure they follow our command, and all should be fine."
 NTR_princess_army:0 "Her Grace’s Soldiers"
 NTR_princess_army_desc:0 "We won more by sheer luck rather than by competence of our army. Though many will not like it, we have to completely reform our military into a more modern force, abolishing old tribal warbands, and creating unified army subservient and held answerable to the Princess."

 NTR_stratify_society_desc:0 "The North is our home, and we are the ones who set the rules. Skynavians are foreign invaders, and though we forgave them, they can’t be let to rule. Of course, any blanket policy would be unfair to the few griffons who lived here for many decades or even centuries and always stood by our side. We simply need some stratification... "
 NTR_friendship_between_races:0 "Friendship Between Species"

 NTR_princess_and_emperor:0 "The Princess and\nThe Emperor"
 NTR_princess_and_emperor_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire is resurgent, and we're now under threat of griffon invasion.

 NTR_south_sovereign:0 "Sovereign of the South"
 NTR_south_sovereign_desc:0 "Why bother with ruling millions of unruly creatures who do not understand our way of life, when we can let their own nobles do it.

 NTR_princess_herzland:0 "Queen of Herzland"
 NTR_princess_herzland_desc:0 "These are weird days indeed... a pony in charge of Herzland...\nOur griffon followers urged Fiana to claim rulership over these lands, yet no Herzlander will be content with a pony occupying the Throne of Grovers. We have a solution though..."

 NTR_perils_logistics:0 "Perils of Logistics"
 NTR_perils_logistics_desc:0 "Modern war is not just screaming and running towards the enemy – it’s a complex operation, highly dependent on organisation of supply deliveries. Hopefully we can order someone else to deal with that – ponies who will specialise in this...“logistics” thing."

ntribes.01.t:0 "Last of Her Blood"
 ntribes.01.d:0 "When Fiana was younger, she loved to play in the maze of corridors that was the Snowflake Palace. Generation after generation expanded it – both up and down below the earth – to show the glory of the princely dynasty of the north. Seven crystal towers rose well above other structures of this kind in Everfrost – known not without reason as the City of Crystal Spires. Now however, the Palace felt... empty. It’s not like there were no other ponies living here, in fact, it was quite the opposite – the royal guard, librarians caring for a vast collection of books and numerous servants called it home. However, except for a few old stewards, she had no one she could entrust her fears and doubts to. Her mother perished years ago, stricken by a disease, her father and brothers died fighting the wretched Skynavians... When she, the last of the Snowflakes – then just a scared filly – was crowned years ago, she had not yet known what kind of burden was laid upon her shoulders. She has been trying her best, but seemingly, all hee attempts had failed. The griffons were slowly winning, and she could do nothing to stop them.\nEvery day she listened to pleas of ponies in an effort to ease disputes among the clans, but as time passed, fewer and fewer cared to ask for her opinion. More and more listened to Euan Stormshield and his griffon friend Oscar Plumenjar. She had nothing personal against Oscar, he was charming and has been living among ponies for many years, respecting their ways... But Euan used him to preach a message of becoming more like griffons. Could this be the right way? Perhaps the old ways of her father and countless ancestors have indeed failed? Doubts, endless doubts... The impending Great Council would be decisive – she could feel that. Her support would be decisive..."
 ntribes.01.a:0 "...but could she make the right choice?"
 ntribes.02.t:0 "Forbidden Knowledge"
 ntribes.02.d:0 "The priests of Ice were rare guests in the Snowflake Palace. They tended to stay in their ice vaults, and left them only if dire need appeared. It was even weirder then that Gavin the Frost Beard decided to personally arrive at the capital and requested an audience. The Druid was... ancient: frail and white-haired, he looked like he could be as old as the palace itself, and rumors about his age gave him anywhere from ninety to three hundred years. Despite this, he moved surprisingly swiftly,\n“Princess Fiana...” the druid said as he approached the throne and slightly bowed. \n“Archdruid Gavin, pleasure to host you in the capital... Bring the venerable Gavin a chair!” She ordered her servants. The druid sat down on the provided chair with a sigh of relief,\n“Thank you, Your Highness. My knees are not as good as they used to be. But that’s not the reason why I asked for this audience. We, in the Circle of Ice, are aware how dire the situation is, and we might have a solution for your problems. One of my students has recently found a map that may lead us to the Vault of Broken Swords...”\n“Isn’t that the place where the Blizzard Kings, defeated by my forefather, were buried, along with their armies?” Interrupted Fiana. \n“Precisely, Your Highness! I must praise your diligence in studying old stories.” Gavin smiled warmly, “If only more young ponies cared to study history... But, getting to the point: you probably know what the story says about the power the Kings of Blizzard held, and how they crushed entire griffon armies that tried to conquer our lands...”\n“I also know that they were consumed by that power and later ruled like tyrants. It was my ancestor that defeated them and freed eastern tribes.” Replied the princess.\n“Yes, that’s unfortunate.” The old pony nodded. “But I've studied legends my whole life, and I believe it was not the power itself that corrupted them, but the darkness within their hearts. The circumstances demand this might, we ponies once wielded, princesses. And once the war is over, we will bury the old knowledge back where we found it.”\nFiana stayed silent for a while. She knew these stories – about ponies whose hearts turned into ice, heroes, turned bloodthirsty tyrants. But, indeed, they had once repelled creatures – both mortal and supernatural – that had threatened the very existence of ponykind. And, well, she knew the archdruid – he was once a friend of her father and was always kind to her. He was a good pony, and she could trust him..."
 ntribes.02.a:0 "“Just, please, be careful.”"
 ntribes.02.b:0 "“The risk is too high, Archdruid.”"
 ntribes.07.t:0 "Dreams"
 ntribes.07.d:0 "The sky turned dark. Starting from the East, it slowly turned from the usual blue to nearly pitch-blackness – darker than even during summer storms... Something was coming – something that made Fiana tremble in fear. She looked around, but there was nothing she could hide behind – all around her, up to the horizon, there was only a flat, icy wasteland. She could not move even an inch, paralyzed by fear of what was coming...\nA great blizzard, an unstoppable force approaching from the East, was coming closer to her, and the only thing she could do was to stand and watch.\nShe woke up right when the blizzard hit her. Like many previous nights, this one bore another nightmare for her. Recently, they started getting worse, and the feelings of anxiety and dread were returning even during daytime. Many druids have approached her, claiming something was wrong. The spirits were angered and... terrified. This was affecting those susceptible to their influence. And as a member of the Snowflake clan, her ties to the northern spirits were special.\nBut what could have caused this disturbance? Her thoughts followed archdruid Gavin. It’s been weeks since he had set off for the Vault of Broken Swords, with few of his students, and no news had come about what happened to them. Perhaps it was a bad decision to let him go...The only thing she could do now was wait – no one except the archdruid and his disciples knew the way to the long-forgotten crypts..."
 ntribes.07.a:0 "Those are just dreams..."
 ntribes.06.t:0 "Wayward Druid"
 ntribes.06.d:0 "We've just received news that Archdruid Gavin ignored the princess’s will, and with a group of most trusted students, headed East towards the Vault of Broken Swords. Those in the Circle of Ice who disagreed with Gavin decided to warn us about this development, and with their help, we may be able to track the archdruid and prevent him from releasing whatever malevolent forces were buried in that cursed place."
 ntribes.06.a:0 "Gather the warriors!"
 ntribes.08.t:0 "The Vault of Broken Swords"
 ntribes.08.d:0 "If not for Sorcha, they would never have even a remote chance of finding the Vault of Broken Swords among all the snow-covered rocks of the mountainside. A sudden blizzard masked the tracks left by Gavin and his students, making traditional ways of tracking impossible. Luckily, the young druid was able to navigate using barely visible symbols left by the Vault's builders.\nFor many hours the band of warriors traversed a long valley. Despite being veterans of a two-decade-long war with griffons, battle-hardened ponies huddled close together... Something was wrong about this godsforsaken place, yet they could not say what exactly. Nature seemed to avoid it. Not a single bird or snow fox showed itself or made a sound and the local trees grew deformed and twisted in unnatural ways.\nFinally, they neared they destination – a large barrow's entrance, once blocked by enormous boulder, which now lay broken into pieces by an unknown force, stood before them. Warriors drew their weapons and entered. Walls inside were covered in symbols of a long-forgotten language, known only to a few, eldest members of the Circle of Ice. Yet even the remote knowledge Scorcha possessed, made her shudder, as she tried to decipher the writing.\n“It is some kind of warning... It speaks of damnation and undoing of the soul... And pleas of mercy for those who are burrowed here. We must hurry.”\nWarriors grumbled in confirmation and followed the druid. Soon they were descending into the underground part of the Vault. Walls of wood and rock were replaced by ice, and within them one could see vague pony silhouettes – a typical way of burial for northern ponies. Scorcha led the group firmly forward through the mazelike walkways, heading in the only direction she knew was the correct one. The young mare moved stiffly as if each step required overcoming an invisible obstacle. It took a long time, but finally they reached the entrance to a large chamber, out of which came a strong metallic scent..."
 ntribes.08.a:0 "...the smell of blood."
 ntribes.09.t:0 "Forging an Alliance"
 ntribes.09.d:0 "East to Elf Lake lies the famed Holy Forge. A seat of power of the Moltenrock clan, from which the bulk of magical swords and armours used by northern ponies originate. One of the five great clans, and the only one composed nearly solely of unicorns, Moltenrock clan was among the most influential and rich entities in the land. Even though spears and swords could not beat modern firearms, the steady flow of equipment from the clan's forge was providing northern ponies with some means of fighting the griffon menace. However, other ponies often considered Moltenrocks to be a bit unhinged – no normal pony would want to live next to a volcano and harness its power using magic. Not to say about their unhealthy fascination with fire and metal... Many ponies in the forge were wearing metal masks or even had their body parts replaced with magitek prosthetics that sometimes looked... disturbing.\n“I must say, it’s quite an impressive piece of machinery...” one such pony was currently examining a machine gun imported from the south. Half of his face was covered with burns, and his right eye had been replaced by a crudely shaped crystal, placed in a metal socket. “Older metalshapers opposed the usage of gunpowder and griffon technology, claiming it lacked 'soul'. But with such marvelous examples of engineering, even they are getting excited by the prospect of improving it...”\n“So.” Oscar Plumenjar cleared his throat trying to win over the enthusiastic pony's attention, “Do we have a deal?”\n“Ah yes... Yes, we do. Clan Moltenrock will support Stormshields, as long as we will be the first ones to study any obtained foreign technology. We will vouch for you during the Council.”\n“Thank you.” Oscar nodded, “I’m certain our cooperation will be of mutual benefit.”\n“Yes. Yes, it surely will... But if I may ask, why are you, a griffon, supporting Euan's cause and helping us fight other griffons? And why do you bother with our clan politics?” His magitek eye turned to the griffon, while the organic one was still focused on the machine gun. Oscar almost shuddered at such an unnatural move.\n“Well... I love this land, its traditions. Ponies accepted me and helped me in my exile... This land to me is home, much more than Cloudbury ever was. And I'd hate to see it overrun by Skynavians. Even if it requires ponies to be more like griffons, we must prevent this...”\n“The old chiefs' mumbling, 'We need to protect the old ways...'” Smirked the unicorn, “They forget that here in the north one always needs to change and adapt to survive – that's our way of life. It’s like smelting one cast and making a new one...”"
 ntribes.09.a:0 "“...it’s still the same metal.”"
 ntribes.54.t:0 "The Aftermath"
 ntribes.54.d:0 "Only one pony of the group, we sent to the Vault of Broken Swords, returned. Young druid Scorcha refused to answer any questions about what exactly happened inside, saying only that both her warriors and archdruid Gavin have perished and that she collapsed the entrance to the Vault and destroyed all signs that could lead anyone to that cursed place. Soon after that, she left Everfrost – with the last traces of her being found in the southern mountains. Hopefully, no one else will try to find the Vault. And per our request, the Circle of Ice has destroyed all documents in their archives that may contain information about its location."
 ntribes.54.a:0 "Some things should stay forgotten."
 ntribes.03.t:0 "The Clans"
 ntribes.03.d:0 "Petty rivalries and generations‐long feuds are a norm in Tìr Deighe. Even though all conflict is regulated by a set of ancient customs and laws, tribesponies' temper and stubbornness tend to inflate their disputes out of proportion. For centuries the most important job of their princes and princesses was to mediate and be neutral judges – the ones, whose word was respected even by the oldest and most obstinate clan elders.\nThough there are many clans, the so-called Five Great Clans are the ones who actually “run” the nation – and all the smaller tribes are usually in one way or another related or affiliated with one of the Great Five. Each of these clans has been blessed by one of the Spirits, and some of its members possess specific kinds of elemental magic. When centuries ago Cainnech Snowflake unified the tribes, they began to work together for the greater good of northern ponies, and via spirit magic, they turned the northern tundra into thriving land.\nThe arrival of Skynavians changed everything. Before, interactions with southrons were rare: occasional trade contact, raids conducted by bandits out of their mountain hideouts or young vedinian knights looking for glory were tolerated, and only the ever-restless Stormshields eagerly tried to contact outsiders. Now, with the Skynavian threat looming in the west, many sided with the Stormshields, and began adopting griffon technology. Famed artificers of clan Moltenrock officially allied with Euan Stormshield and so did many smaller clans. With rumours that clan Barkcoat may also sway to support Euan, the traditionalist camp, comprised of Brightflames and Greenhooves, became a minority in the Tribal Council – even with backing of the Speakers of the Dead who, though not a clan, hold a substantial amount of influence, thanks to their role as custodians of clans' history.\nAs alliances shifted, Princess Fiana found herself in a precarious situation: many expected her to support the cause of traditionalist clans, but that would alienate a large number of northern ponies. Still, her endorsement had power – and whoever she gave it to would benefit greatly during the Great Council."
 ntribes.03.a:0 "It’s worse than herding cats..."
 ntribes.04.t:0 "A friend from the East"
 ntribes.04.d:0 "The city of Frostbell... Well, calling it a “city” is a stretch as it is more a collection of fisherponies’ huts and houses, taverns and other “fine establishments”, visited only by sailors crazy enough to sail around the Dread Peninsula to travel eastward, to rich pony nations of the Riverlands. The route is a dangerous one, plagued by changeling and hillpony pirates and deadly beasts, born from dark magic that holds the peninsula in its clutches. But it is also immensely profitable. A daring captain could sell furs, crystals or works of art  in return for modern weapons from Bakara which are in high demand due to the seemingly eternal struggle with Skynavians.\nA sudden blow of wind made Euan tremble. He buried deeper into his furry coat and stopped daydreaming about distant lands... A ship was slowly approaching, and after a few minutes it moored to the wharf. A small, steam-powered freighter was nevertheless the largest ship in the port. After a few more minutes, when the crew was busy unloading crates, a young mare went down the ladder. Euan waved to her,\n“Amber, over here!”\nThe mare quickly trotted towards him and they embraced.\n“Long time no see!” she laughed, “I hope you did not have to wait too long.”\n“Three days' delay is not that bad, all things considered. By the way, how was the journey?” asked Euan.\n“Surprisingly quiet, only once something like a giant shark tried to ram us... How are things here?”\n“Same as usual, the Princess doesn't know what to do, old pricks say all was better before the Skynavians, snow was whiter, grass was greener...” responded Euan, massaging his forehead, “And how about...”\n“...the deal? Good, even very good.Though I did not manage to talk to anyone in power, there were more than enough businessponies interested in the venture. If you secure the northern passage, they will pay us handsomely and will be willing to invest in our mining operations.”"
 ntribes.04.a:0 "“This is excellent news!”"
 ntribes.107.t:0 "The Return"
 ntribes.107.d:0 "The Hall of Gatherings was filled with ponies: clan elders, their advisors, allies and various “guests of honour”. The princess welcomed one delegation after another, desperately trying to recall all the names of those she hadn't met in years... The seating arrangement was carefully pre-planned to place feuding clans away from each other to avoid brawls. Suddenly, the doors opened with a loud “Blam!”, hitting the walls as if pushed by some powerful force. Behind it stood a group of ponies, wearing ceremonial robes of the druids of Ice, hoods covering their faces. Fiana recognised the old pony leading them – it was Archdruid Gavin!\n“Venerable Gavin!” Fiana welcomed him, “We haven't met in a while... I trust your journey was fruitful?”\n“More than you can imagine, Princess,” he responded. There was no trace of elderly weakness in his voice, he sounded like a mighty pony in his golden years. “I have returned from the Vault of Broken Swords with knowledge. And a solution to all our problems.”\n“From where?!” Head of clan Moltenrock nearly choked upon hearing this. “Princess, what’s he saying? The Vault is just a legend to scare naughty foals!”\n“It’s not a legend!” disagreed one of the invited druids, “but it was to be forgotten for a reason. It is a place of great evil.“\n“Archdruid, explain...” the princess tried to speak, but was interrupted.\n“Elders and clans leaders,” Gavin started to talk while walking past Fiana, “for years I’ve been looking for a solution to bring us salvation, to defeat our enemies and let us take the position we, ponies, deserve. And what have the other leaders done? They argued pointlessly, unable to find a way to save our kind. Some even proposed to imitate the despicable griffons.” The druid pointed to Euan Stormshield.\n“Others misunderstood what it really means to honour the way of our ancestors, blinded by superstitious fear. All of you know stories of the winters that lasted for years, of ice storms so destructive that they razed entire cities... And I’ve found a way to unleash such powers. Not only this, but also a way to create armies that will slaughter the griffons! Behold!” His companions took off their hoods, revealing faces of long‐dead warriors, raised from their ice graves, their features still covered with unmelting hoarfrost. Then the Archdruid removed his own robe. His eyes were blank and there was a large scar on his chest, and beneath it – a pulsating blue light."
 ntribes.107.a:0 "What is happening?!"
 ntribes.55.t:0 "Blizzard"
 ntribes.55.d:0 "Reactions in the crowd were mixed: some ponies were clearly fascinated, but many more were terrified or disgusted.\n“I have liberated myself from the shackles of life and death!” gavin nearly screamed, “And so may those who will follow me. Great power awaits all of us. We will no longer serve weak spirits, instead, we will command them! Join me, so we can finally inflict our revenge upon griffons! For every pony slain, we shall slay tenfold as many griffons! Winter shall reign eternal, and we will be its masters!” There was something hypnotic about Gavin's words, something that exaggerated all the anger and hatred ponies felt...\nAfter a brief moment of silence, one of the druids shook off the shock.\n“This is sacrilege! Madness and sacrilege! Stop this madpony!” What followed was utter chaos: guards drew their weapons, less brave ponies chose to run from the Hall. The archdruid simply raised his hoof...\nA vortex of snow and ice surrounded him, shards of razor-sharp ice screamed towars his attackers, and his resurrected warriors rushed in to slaughter the opposition, with those who decided to join Gavin fighting the rest of the assembly. After a few minutes the hall was filled with bodies, and the floor was slippery from all the blood that was spilled. Gavin and his followers were victorious. Princess Fiana stood there in the middle of this madhouse, paralyzed by the sight of mindless killing. Gavin looked at the bodies\n“I hope their successors will be more... willing to cooperate. And about the rest... You made a wise choice, friends. The task ahead of us is great, but we will prevail. Now, go to your clans and bring them joyful news: We are going to war!”\n“To war! Revenge!” screamed the remaining clansponies, raising their weapons.\n“Good.” the archdruid grinned, “Get the Princess,” he ordered his undead henchponies, “we will need her.”\nA few miles away, thousands of undead soldiers were marching towards the capital."

Sadly, this was the only good thing that could be said about the clans' gathering. No kind of compromise was reached; reformers and traditionalists argued to no end  and it quickly became obvious that neither side had enough support to dominate the Council. A large enough number of neutral clans looked to the princess for guidance – and it was up to her to decide what route the Northern Tribes would follow."

However recently, ponies have begun rapid modernisation, and now we are being visited by their diplomats. Apparently, they want to join our alliance.

 ntribes.11.d:0 "Halls of the Snowflake Palace were filled with both ponies and griffons. For decades Everfrost has not seen so many creatures from near and far visiting the capital of northern ponies. But rarely one has the opportunity to see a coronation – and indeed the very first one of its kind. Today, Princess Fiana was being crowned Queen of the North. With this act, a new state would be born, a country of both ponies and griffons. Many of the foreign guests were astounded by the fact that ponies managed to conquer such vast swathes of northern Griffonia. But what had once seemed impossible for northern ponies now was a reality, and few could deny how astounding their victory was. Everyone's eyes were turned to Fiana, as the newly forged crown was lowered on her head by the eldest druid in the land. Chieftains, clan elders and griffon governors kneeled to pay homage to their new sovereign, and one of them shouted loudly, “Long live the Queen! Long live the united North!” Moments later, the rest joined in the chant. But while the crowds praised Fiana, the true architect of this moment oversaw the ceremony from one of the balconies. Euan smiled warmly: years of his exhausting work finally paid off, years of plotting, fighting and arduous diplomacy... He was tired, but happy.\n“They should belaud you instead.” Sounds of the crowd let Amber approach Euan unnoticed, “You are the one who made it possible. Think of what they'll write in history books *Under wise leadership of the Princess, the North was united and prospered*.”\n“They probably will.” somberly responded Euan, “But I never cared much for the splendor of nobility. Looks to me like it gets boring quickly, seeing how princes behave. I prefer action to all these empty rituals.”\n“Yeah, that sounds like you... So, what now?” Euan smiled,\n“There's still some work to do, problems will not disappear only because our ruler has a fancy new title. Next few years will be busy. And later... I think I’ll go to see all the places I read about. Perhaps Equestria? From what you told me, it seems truly marvelous.”\n“It is.” Amber Smiled. “Well, when you decide to retire from being a puppetmaster, I'll show you around.”"

However, there are many more riches hidden beneath its frozen earth: precious metals, crystals, coal and oil... The North is abundant in natural resources for the ponies never needed to exploit them. But the times have changed, and now these resources would be used to finance the war and due modernisation. Euan sent more envoys to the Riverlands – with promises of great wealth in return for help. And luckily for the northern ponies the Riverlanders got interested in what the North could offer – most notably, a freely exploitable deposit of gold, for development of which Euan would provide them with labourers. Though the deposit lay on the land considered holy by one of the smaller clans, this issue was not unsolvable – in these times of struggle a generous donation from Euan convinced the desperate elders that their land was not ‘that’ holy – and before disgruntled zealots could put up a protest, gold was already getting, and the promised shipments of weaponry were en route to Frostbell."

 ntribes.13.t:0 "Young Blood"
 ntribes.13.d:0 "There are few creatures more stubborn than an old pony. In the North some clan conflicts could last for generations. A single old slight was enough to ensure that some clans will simply not get along ever again. To add insult to injury, some older chieftains would oppose any change only because they were not the ones who proposed it, not letting anyone else decide on the matters that may affect their clan. It took Euan years to convince first his own clan and later Moltenrocks to support him, with Barkcoats following him only because of the princess’ support. Over the course of his political activity, Euan lost all envy for Snowflakes and their princely lineage. Ruling the North was an absolute nightmare. Turning every clan elder to his side would take Euan a few long years – an endeavour too costly when time was so precious. Luckily, every chieftain and elder had a few power-hungry and ambitious younger underlings who were much more susceptible to Euan’s reasoning, let alone promises of power, which also would put them in debt to him – a handy thing among dutiful Northerners.\nOf course, a few clans would rather perish than join his coalition due to centuries-old grievances against its members; but each of them had some more pragmatic enemies. And so messengers were sent to reluctant clans. With bribes, promises of great wealth and power, economic upturn, policies to be issued by the Princess that favoured more complacent clans over hardliners... and where nothing could help, all kinds of assistance for pretenders was provided to challenge old leaders and depose them. It did not take long before resistance to planned reforms melted like snow on a sunny Spring day. Clans supported Euan – and if he lead them to victory, his position would be secured for a lifetime. If not..."

 ntribes.14.d:0 "Twenty years of low-scale conflict led to nothing: we are exhausted, and the Skynavians are growing stronger. With volunteers arriving every day to join their revolution, it is obvious that they’re preparing for the final showdown. They have much better guns, advanced tactics and are fanatical believers of their communist cause. They however grossly underestimate us, thinking we are just savages. Time has come to prove them wrong. We will no longer idly wait for the inevitable. We must prepare for war, and start it on our own terms.\nBut there stands a question of how to act. Though most suggestions of the warchiefs are worthless, a few interesting ideas did pop up. First, we could fortify and then provoke the Skynavians to attack our defences – then we bleed them out. However, due to the sheer length of the border, it may be problematic to fully cover it, so perhaps a more offensive approach should be taken. Before our offensive, a few warbands could sneak across the border in order to raid Skynavian supply lines. Finally, we can try to contact the ponies that still live in the west and hastily prepare them for battle, hopefully letting us overwhelm the Skynavians with numbers."

 ntribes.15.d:0 "Now when Skynavia is under our control, we need to address the problem of ponies lusting for vengeance. Many of our tribesponies still have some legitimate ire towards Skynavians who have undeniably caused lots of destruction and suffering over twenty years of war. However, most members of the Skynavian leadership responsible for their atrocities have perished in battle or escaped to fight for the communist cause in some distant lands. Satisfying the demand for retribution would force us to punish some low-level officers, randomly picked from the ranks of the former Skynavian army, which will surely put a strain on our future relations with griffon nations. Trying only those directly guilty of harmful actions against civilians and forgiving the remaining Skynavians would be both good for our international relations and the clearly moral thing to do. Though many clans will be against it, such an act of forgiveness can start a peaceful coexistence of ponies and griffons in the Northern lands – and with enough Equestrian talk of friendship even most obstinate ponies will one day come to believe in it."

With reconquest of the west, exiled clans wished to return to their ancestral lands... However, large swathes of them were now occupied by griffons, and what used to be untamed wilds had been appropriated for mining, forestry, and farming... It is obvious that griffons will not pleased to leave... And honestly, they’ve done quite a good job with appropriating these previously barren lands for various economic uses. While it may be tempting to let griffons keep the land, we cannot really do this as the backslash would be immense, and Euan would soon see his head on a pike in the worst-case scenario. On the other hand, forcing griffons out will bring no benefit in the long term. There might however be a way to convince both sides to follow some sort of an arrangement, where ponies would own this territory, but griffons could pay for right to use it... If all other methods fail, money solves any conflict."

 ntribes.17.t:0 "A Breeze of Change"
 ntribes.17.d:0 "Not long ago nearly void of life, Snowflake Palace was now filled with ponies – and recently – griffons. Euan Stormshield and his various aides occupied more and more halls and rooms, and nascent bureaucracy of their Northern realm seemed to mature with each passing day. Things were going exceptionally smoothly, Skynavians were eager to cooperate, and despite complaints from some cheifs, Euan invited many of them to help him with governing a reunited Tìr Deighe. Malcontents were silenced by his recent successes, and his control was nearly absolute. Fiana, always shy and timid, rarely opposed his actions – and even when she did, he would invariably overpower her via lengthy tirades about the necessity of change and a recounting of his previous successes. She was indeed a very kind pony, but lacked the resolve any leader must possess. Apparently, feeling much better in the role of a symbol. Less real governance, more waving to her subjects during parades – that was her thing. Perhaps griffon republicans were indeed right, and the days of monarchy were long gone...\nNevertheless, Euan found his uses for Fiana, and even though his new Skynavian advisors suggested getting rid of her to free up some space and money, he saw her potential as a powerful unifying symbol.\nEven with his usual hyperactivity, Euan could not be everywhere, he needed to delegate tasks, and could not afford to run this country alone anymore – even though that simplified a lot of issues. He needed support from both ponies and griffons if he wanted to achieve his dreams. With clans weaker than ever, he could finally set up a centralized government with Fiana in charge or follow the Skynavian example and reform the Great Council to include not just the tribal chiefs, but all settlement leaders within the lands, introducing more fair representation and democratic voting."

While exporting timber, animal furs, and minerals covers our current import needs, the margins we’re getting are too tight for industrialisation’s needs. Due to the nearly non-existent nature of our ‘government’, until now there was not really a need for a well-organized tax policy, and the princess relied on small tributes from various clans. However, now comes the time to introduce proper taxation. Of course, the higher taxes we’ll demand, the more ponies will complain, and our position will be weakened."

 ntribes.19.d:0 "Gordon the Archer... few ponies fought as long as he did, still fewer lost as much. Hailing from one of the smaller clans, nearly wiped out by Sunstriker’s raiders, Gordon has fought griffons at every opportunity, be them Vedinan glory-seeking knights, southern bandits, fanatical Skynavians – he faced them all. Even after losing his eyes, when he miraculously survived a nearly direct hit by an artillery shell, he fought on and – even though he was not very useful in the field – offered invaluable advice. Most chieftains respected him, and the princess saw in that the best way to unify the many competing warbands of the North into a semblance of an army. And there she sat vis-a-vis him, unsure of what to say. Gordon felt friendly – even without eyes to look into – perhaps, even too friendly. Fiana sensed that he wasn’t ready to treat her seriously: to him, she was only a child.\n“It’s not like I do not appreciate the invitation, princess, but I’m a busy pony. You know, when you are old, each day counts, as there are few of them left.” Out of nowhere, he started the dialogue, “What is exactly the purpose of this meeting?”\n“Gordon, I want to ask you for help. Our warriors lack direction, they need one leader, but the chieftains won’t listen to me. You, however, they respect, no matter clan allegiance.”\n“This ‘leader’ being you?” Half-asked, half-stated Gordon, “You might be the princess, a symbol of clans’ unity, but you have no experience in warfare. You would do more bad than good. Just keep smiling during councils and all will be fine. Let the grown-ups deal with war.”\nFiana recognised this as a taunt and swiftly came back at Gordon, matching his adversarial tone and upping the tempo, barely overcoming herself,\n“Yes, I might have no experience, but unlike stubborn old fools who lead our warriors I want to learn and can listen to others. I ask you for help, because it's faster than meeting each chieftain and pandering to their delusions of grandeur. I will not be offended in my own home! Role of the princess is to lead her subjects – not just ‘smile’. And in this I’m going to fulfill my duties!”\n“You have guts, girl!” Laughed Gordon. “You are a true Snowflake just like your father! Seemingly nice and quiet, but a true warrior at heart... My princess, from now on I will represent you before the warchiefs. Just listen to my advice as you promised to. Hot-blooded youngsters do no good when the times demand calm and tactics.”"

 ntribes.20.d:0 "Snowflake Palace housed many masterpieces created by great craftsmen of past ages – one of them being a giant “map”, carved out of stone to resemble the Northlands. Though it lacked the precision of modern military maps the princess had seen a few times in her life, it was nevertheless a helpful aide in explaining one's plans. Today the princess invited a few more experienced chieftains and loyal clan leaders to discuss the ongoing war.\n“The truth is, princess,” Sighed Gordon the Archer, “that we are losing. Even I can see it.” None laughed at his joke. Though blind Gordon was not able to properly command warriors in the field, there was no more experienced strategist in the North than him – and no-one more respected by the warriors. His word was not to be taken lightly. “If we continue fighting as before, we have no hope of beating the griffons. Every day more of these fanatics arrive in Skynavia to fight us, and they simply have better weapons than us.”\n“There is another thing.” Added Euan Stormshield, the most recent, though still not very enthusiastic addition to Fiana’s war council. “Some of my ponies caught Skynavian spies. They had orders to sow dissent and cause an uprising. What is worse, they managed to muster a following among our own.”\n“Only because you’d primed them with your subversive ideas.” Snarked Gordon.\n“Please, let’s not argue.” Jumped in Fiana. “Bickering doesn’t help. We need solutions. That’s why I gathered you here. We’ve failed on many fronts, but there must be something we can get right.”\n“Fighting Skynavians in small skirmishes is pointless,” Offered Euan. “We need to prepare a large-scale offensive, before they start one of their own.”\n“I support the young Stormshield,” Agreed Gordon. “No-one knows this land better than us. Griffons won’t be able to detect our scouts while they prepare routes for our warriors.”\n“What about our defences?” Inquired the princess.\n“Well, we can expand some forts and hope they hold,” Replied Gordon. “But it will take a lot of effort, and we don't have much time or ponies.”\n“About ponies,” Euan grinned. “There may be a solution: I talked to some smugglers, who had contacted our western brethren. Their warriors are ready and willing to assist us from behind enemy lines. Whatever we do, we need to act quickly, otherwise the communists will be here first.”"

Yet, many other ponies adopted his vision, and without his support, leading the tribes would prove rather difficult. Luckily, Stormshields were not warriors by calling, but merchants, and as such they were much more open-minded than many other northern ponies. Presently, the princess was attending the showcase event of Euan’s newest purchase – a mighty cannon, brought straight from the Riverlands. A few of his tribesponies, directed by a Moltenrock unicorn, were busy preparing it for a test shot, while Euan was giving a protracted speech about fascinating prospects of cooperation with the East.\n “...this is far from the best we can get from them, princess! Weapons, electronics, new farming and mining equipment... We need it all!”\n “Chief, we’re ready!” Called out the unicorn in charge of the cannon crew. And after a moment’s deliberation, with a thunderous sound, the cannon fired, turning a nearby rock formation into a dusty mess.\n “I must admit, it is quite impressive,” Fiana used this opportunity to finally say something. “But what about other clans? They do not want to abandon the ways of their forefathers in favour of pretending to be griffons.”\n “It is natural to fear change.” Responded Euan, “And though I’m not pleased with it, I’m aware that other clans may not be as receptive as mine. In time, they will come to accept change if they want to survive.”\n “We must not forget who we are.” Said Fiana mindlessly, as if reciting an axiom.\n “What could have been true a hundred years ago may not apply to our times... Well, that’s not a conversation for today. For now I’m pleased with the current deal. Moltenrocks are more than happy to experiment with weapons like one I just showed you, and I promise that results will be even more impressive...” Euan went back to his monologue.

Even now, with pony warriors on guard and patrol duties everywhere around, griffons crowded the steets, going about their everyday issues. The younger ones seemingly unbothered by the regime change – some even trying to be friendly to the ponies. Yet, the older griffons who were not born here, and partook in the conquest of this land, were clearly on the verge of getting into open fights with “reactionary occupiers”. Luckily, there weren’t many of them, otherwise violence would be inevitable.\nAt the arrival of the Princess, multiple prominent griffons requested an audience – most were quite polite, very different from the brutes of pony war stories – and they all talked about the future prospects and peace. Griffons were tired of war, which had lasted for twenty long years. Many of them were born here or brought here as children, and the ideologues of the revolution were mostly dead, or had fled Skynavia in the face of its imminent defeat. The remaining administration hoped for a new start of griffon-pony relations in the North. However, among the older populus many were vengeful, and wanted payback. They thought peace between griffons and ponies was impossible, and that griffons had to go back South.\nIt was up to the Princess to make the decision – one that would surely shape the North for the years to come."

Well, things are much more complicated, and griffons are turned out to be even more ideologically fractured than we are. Luckily, most of them can be reasoned with, but there are numerous radical groups, the beliefs of which we were not even able to understand. Some Skynavians tried to explain it to us, but it only made our heads hurt. For example... “Hive-mind communism”? What does that even mean? Do they eat bees? Apparently, it is supposed to be a serious philosophy, and there is a group practicing it somewhere in the woods. (Spirits forbid they touch our apiaries!) No matter what they call themselves, these groups mostly refuse to submit to us – and threaten violence if we so much as touch the lands they occupy – land that until very recently belonged to our clansponies, who are supremely unhappy with their homes being taken over by some squatters. We can send our warriors to disperse these communes, but this will probably result in armed conflict. Hopefully, no one will protest this, as not even the rest of Skynavians like these weirdos. Alternatively, we could leave the land to them, but this will put us at odds with several clan chiefs."

There was always some public figure requesting an audience, a decision to be made, a Very Important Festival to attend... However, now with the griffon problem solved, everything calmed down. After years of hard work, one day Fiana found herself lacking anything even remotely important to do. There was not a single dispute among the clans, none of her subordinates asked for orders... Peace and quiet. It was in fact a bit unnerving! She roamed the palace for some time, distracting servants until finally settling down in one of the greenhouses to rest a bit. Gardens of the Snowflake Palace were one of its many wonders: merchants brought many exotic and beautiful plants from the South, which were then cultivated here. Thanks to pony magic and mastery of the glassblowers, these amazing structures supported various warmth-loving fauna alive in the harsh climate of the North.\nWhen Fiana was a filly, she spent a lot of time in these gardens, playing out adventures in the mysterious southern lands, trekking through vast jungles and exploring lost temples, like in one of the books she found in the palace’s library. Those were the simpler, better days... Fiana sat on a bench, enjoying the smell of blooming flowers.\nWas this going to be her life from now on? Quiet, nearly identical days... With the old way triumphant, few changes will happen in the North, and with bonds between the clans stronger than ever, even the once-tedious task of dealing with their disputes wasn’t that stressful anymore.\nYes. She hoped it would be like that. She would not miss the days of war, struggle, and fear. After twenty long years of strife, her ponies deserved peace – and so did she.

The battle that ensued was long and brutal: Stormshields were aware they would be given no pardon and fought to the bitter end. Though they repelled a few initial assaults, the undead kept attacking day and night, leaving them no time to rest. After a few days, when the defenders became completely exhausted, came time for the final strike. However, to the Archdruid’s irritation, most of the remaining militant ponies had already left the city before or during the siege, either heading to the lands of Arcturians or leaving for Farbrook by sea. Euan Stormshield himself also fled – the coward did not even have enough courage to fight for his cause like all those he had left behind. The Archdruid decided not to pursue them, as clan Stormshield had been decisively broken, and all its members of body and age had died or fled.

Apparently, lands of northern ponies are now under control of dark magic practitioners – the Cult of Ice, who recently began purging all the dissenters. We are unable to do anything with it due to the sheer distance between our nations, but at least we can help these poor ponies find a new home in Farbrook."
 ntribes.61.a:0 "It is our duty to shelter them."
 ntribes.29.t:0 "The Price"
 ntribes.29.d:0 "It is not easy to reach the ghost of a dead creature, as most of them is too far away for contact – without the use of necromancy. And even if one resorted to bringing back the dead, all they could hope to summon usually was just a twisted shade of the dead creature’s soul. However, there were beings too powerful and too unwilling to abandon the material world. Such souls could stick to their corporeal remnants for ages. There was a reason why druids avoided them – they were often twisted and vengeful. They always wanted something in return when asked for help. Lost souls obsessed with their failures, spirits who had thirsted for power in life – and let this desire consume them in death. The longer they were stuck in the mortal world, the more they strove to experience what they have lost once more.\nEver since his pact with the Blizzard Kings, Gavin could feel their presence – they were always watching, always whispering... For a long time they were deprived of life, until they became mere shades of the mighty ponies they had once been: their personalities have been purged of everything but thirst for vengeance upon those who had wronged them, and an all-consuming desire for power... for life. The only other thing they retained was their knowledge of long-forgotten magic. As per the pact, this they shared with the Archdruid. Now he had the spell he needed – thought to be impossible to conjure for any druid or sorcerer in the northern lands – not even the Blizzard Kings themselves harnessed enough power to unleash it. Normally, it required sacrificing tens of thousands of lives – with no guarantee of success. But Gavin saw another way – saving an entire nation for the price of a single life.\nMembers of clan Snowflake were blessed by all northern spirits – a unique trait they possessed thanks to the founder of the royal dynasty, Cainnech Snowflake, – and there was only one of them left. Ending the life of Fiana, eradicating an entire bloodline of blessed souls, would release enough magical energy to completely destroy Skynavia.\nThe lust for revenge of the Blizzard Kings would be sated, and Gavin would have upheld his part of their pact."
 ntribes.29.a:0 "It needs to be done."
 ntribes.30.t:0 "The Orphaned Nation"
 ntribes.30.d:0 "Since the death of Fiana and destruction of New Skynavia, Tìr Deighe has been slowly dying. For thousands of years, ponies lived in communion with the northern spirits, whose magic flowed through their land. The powers of the druids were the most visible gift of the spirits, but to some extent nearly every pony was blessed by them.\nNow their magic was gone. Though all ponies are somewhat magical creatures, the northern ones were highly reliant on help of their deities, as for most, natural talents of were not enough to survive in this harsh land. So as the crops died, weather became more and more erratic, and the clans began waging war on one another, many elders and druids started to question if they had made the right choice...\nThen, rather unexpectedly, all the druids were invited to Everfrost with a promise of salvation for their tribesponies. They witnessed the powers of the followers of the Frost King, unaffected by the punishment of the Spirits, and were offered a... solution. Many refused – and never left the Snowflake Palace – but those who had accepted the Frost King’s offer and pledged allegiance to him soon found themselves reinvigorated. They got the power they and their tribesponies needed."

 ntribes.31.t:0 "Ascension"
 ntribes.31.d:0 "Many think that modern magic is nothing more than another branch of science – that its place is in universities and factories, and that the age of gods and archmages that could shatter the world is gone. But not in Tìr Deighe... That land is a place where Old Magic reigns supreme. And now there finally was a being who could harness it.\n The war with Skynavia changed northern ponies – more than anyone had thought – and it was clear what they became. Gone were days of peace and harmony. Once long ago, they had been conquerors – an now became them once again. Their gods were weak, and had to be... replaced.\n When armies of the Frost King marched South, they sacked every ancient vault, every library, and every repository of magical knowledge that griffons possessed. There was much to be gained – ancient, dangerous knowledge that griffons had buried in an attempt to make the world forget that it had ever existed. Meanwhile, griffon cities were burning and thousands died. Many more ran south, hoping to save their lives from pony conquerors, and bringing the news about atrocities committed by the invaders.\n Now all was set for the great finale, a ritual unseen since the ancient days. In dozens of holy forests, springs, and other places of magic, followers of the Frost King performed their dark rites, sacrificing hundreds of griffon prisoners to open a way into the Realm of Spirits, to make them... vulnerable.\n As the Northern Spirits were dying, being stripped of their magic by the Frost King’s magical assault, his power only grew. Thus, he would become a living god – a creature able to rival the alicorns – the one who would bring eternal slavery to griffons, and reward the faithful handsomely. The northern ponies felt a pulsing, tingling wave of vigour come over their bodies, as their connection with the Spirits was replaced by something new. And those few who have left Tìr Deighe, running from the madness that had consumed it, would always, until the end of their lives, feel a void in their souls. Their guiding Spirits were dead."

Every few minutes the temperature drops by ten degrees, while the wind is picking up. No fire or shelter helps, as even the concrete starts cracking and breaking. An unnatural blizzard approaches New Skynavia like a tidal wave of destruction and death.\n When it hits, the weather becomes deadly: the temperature becomes sub-polar, the wind tears trees out of the ground, and a tsunami of snow covers the city. The few griffons that are caught outside die in agony, getting flung around by the wind, as their lungs turn to ice from the cold and the snow. Some pray to the gods, asking for salvation – but today their gods aren’t listening.\n Some more sensitive ones had packed up and ran South at the first sign of this apocalypse – their frozen, dry bodies now covered the roads, leading out of the city. The most fortunate were those who chose a quick death by gunshot – preferable to a slow death from cold.\n When the blizzard passed, New Skynavia was no more. Out on the streets lay mangled, disfigured corpses, and inside the buildings those who had survived the longest could be found in piles of lifeless bodies, hugging each other in vain hope of keeping a bit of warmth.\n When pony scouts reached the city they found no one alive – the city was no more, the dream of equality and socialism in the North died with it. The once-busy streets were quiet, covered in a thick layer of snow that did not melt – and would never melt. New Skynavia would forever remain a frozen tomb, and not even the spirits of its inhabitants would be able to leave the fallen city."

 ntribes.52.t:0 "The Ritual"
 ntribes.52.d:0 "The air is buzzing with magical energy as the druids chat the lines of an old ritual. They have been doing so for many days, and not all of them survived to the end – yet even in death, the spirits of those that perished proceeded chanting in ghostly howls, tied by unnatural powers filling the chamber. In the middle of the room, Princess Fiana is chained to the floor, her coat covered with blood from the symbols cut directly on her body. Blood loss and exhaustion have taken a toll on her, but she still somehow remains conscious.\nThe ritual reaches its culmination – the druids end their chant, and Gavin reaches for an old, rusted knife he recovered from the Vault of Broken Swords – the same knife he used to cut his own heart out... Though ever since he had embraced the power of the Blizzard Kings, the gift of eternal life, he felt even stronger than even in his youth, presently, each step towards the Princess seemed to be nigh-impossible. Yet through sheer force of will he pressed on. This had to be done.\nAs he raised the knife, the Archdruid recalled the days when everything was simpler – the days before the arrival of griffons when he advised the father of Fiana, Fothad... Lo, my fair prince, how we have failed you!\nIn a swift motion, he carves the chest of Fiana open, then rips her heart out of it. He raises it up, and the last trace of life fades away from the eyes of the Princess, yet her heart keeps beating...\nEvery thump of the heart reverberates through the chamber, as they become quieter and slower. Finally, with the last beat, the ritual ends. The Spirits of the North are being robbed of their power, as a gigantic blizzard envelops New Skynavia. The death of the last Snowflake in a sacrilegious ritual ends the communion of northern ponies with their deities. Druids across Tìr Deighe feel as if they lost a part of their souls, as those having the strongest connection to the Spirits, they are the most affected.\nAs bodies of those who had perished during the ritual start to rot, the Archdruid looks one last time at the body of Fiana. His eyes almost as lifeless as hers. The voices in his head howl in triumph – their vengeance upon Cainnech Snowflake fulfilled, their thirst for revenge sated."

We have been approached by diplomats from Tir Deighe, who proposed a treaty of cooperation and friendship between the River Coalition and the northerners, as well as a recognition of their state as an honorary member of the Coalition. In return for our assistance, they promise us access to their internal market and help in opening the Northern Sea Passage for trade. While we don’t stand to gain much from from this arrangement, this would not be an expensive endeavour to start off.

In centuries nothing of note has happened there, and most maps described this area as “Here Be Ponies”, “Northern Tribes”, or “Snowy Wasteland”. The latter description must clearly be amended, as now these ponies decided to finally embrace modernity – and came to ask us for help with that. The best way to do so will be letting them participate in our joint research programme. This way, they’ll get all the useful knowledge, and perhaps will also learn something about friendship in the process. Of course, we can just turn them down with no repercussions: it’s not like anyone in Equestria cares about such a distant and remote polity – almost no-one even knows of its existence...

All living creatures that entered the city felt a disturbance, and the warriors that accompanied the Archdruid instinctively huddled together, as they moved further. As for Gavin, it was much, much worse for him: he clearly sensed all these dead souls, their anger, fear and pain. But he had to be here. He needed to witness the results of his actions – now it was his duty to carry the burden, as was the right thing to do. Hundreds of thousands must have perished here, and Skynavia would be forever tainted by dark magic – all directly caused by his actions...\nAs Gavin walked the empty streets, the pressure kept growing. Ghosts sensed his presence, and flocked to their tormentor, staring, judging. A flow of pained rage poured out of every inch of the spiritual aether down onto the Archdruid, until he could no longer handle it. All he wanted then was to retreat deep into himself and cut himself from the souls he had cursed for eternity...\nHe reached inside himself for help, but found no respite – the Spirits were no longer there to guide him, since he had killed them. What he heard was voices of the long-dead, vengeful, tyrants of the past, whispering about revenge, power, and control. They’d long been waiting for him to show weakness, and now finally came their chance to strike!\nArchdruid Gavin collapsed on the ground, seemingly lifeless, and as his companions gathered around, unsure what to do, he suddenly opened his eyes. There was no longer Gavin Frostbeard, there were no Kings of Blizzard. A new being was born – with no regrets and no compassion, and only one aspect of the old druid remaining – a burning desire to protect his kin, the ponies he tried to lead for many decades, and whom he wanted to get what they truly deserved – to no longer live in fear, but to rule over Griffonia..."

Those of the locals who had not escaped before the massacre most likely shared the fate of the fallen soldiers, and the only trace of their existence left was foundations of their burnt-down houses.\nThe sun was already setting when a small group of griffons came to the outskirts of the battlefield. Most of them wounded and covered in dirt, they were in a pitiful state for proud knights of the Silberkralle Order. They’d been on the run for the better part of the day. Though hopefully, their pursuers had lost them by now, they had to move farther, as this was still not a safe place to stay. Some barely visible figures wandered the desolate fields. Perhaps these were only scavengers, but they could be much worse – undead monsters raised by dark pony magic. The knights could not risk crossing paths with more of those creatures in their sorry state.\nGrandmaster Hector stopped for a brief moment. They hadn’t had the time to bury even a part of those they had lost today, so all he could do now was to pray shortly for their peaceful rest. A minute of silent prayer has always helped the knights to gather their spirits in dark times.

The biggest threat came from stray groups of the undead, whom ponies either lost control of or those spontaneously raised by residual dark magic left after necromantic spells of pony battlemages. Nevertheless, Erik Grimclaw's chapter quickly crossed the Heartlands and was now entering Cloudbury, where things started to get much more complicated. Ponies has had the time to solidify their rule here, and locals have learned the price of insubordination. The first mistake Erik made was to stop in a small village, hoping for a bit of rest and some supplies. Though the locals were poor, they seemed welcoming and generous... Only to send an envoy to a nearby pony garrison, discovering the knights. If it wasn’t for Erik’s caution that made him set up sentries, they would’ve been slaughtered. Still, the ensuing fight with the ponies cost the lives of half the Argentumdämmerung knights who had followed him North.\nThrough the streets, between the burning houses, knights dragged the village elder to their leader. Sobbing, he begged for mercy, explaining to Erik that he had no choice. He said that if the ponies ever found out that he helped him out, they’d kill him and send all other villagers to the mines. But in reward for ratting the knights out, their grain burdens would be lowered, and they would have more food to survive the winter. Something cracked in Erik, as he listened to these pathetic excuses. He unsheathed his sword and decapitated the traitor.\n“They deserve no mercy. Kill them all and take their food,” he ordered his griffs. “And be quick. We need to attack the garrison today if we want to leave no evidence.”"

Now, he hid in the bushes several hundred meters away, watching with tearful eyes as the northern barbarians torched the temple. They already took all the items that looked valuable – and some of them were arguing on how to divide the loot. A small fight started between two young hot-bloods over one particularly ornate codex. The argument was cut short by their superior literally cutting the book in half. The ponies hastily picked up the two resulting booklets and put them into their bags. After an hour or two, the warband moved on further South, leaving the burning temple behind. It took another hour for Gerhard to muster his courage and leave his hiding spot. He went back to the place he had called home for so long to pick up whatever remained of the holy books and symbols scattered in the mud and ashes...\nAll across the conquered griffon lands a new edict was being enforced: all forms of worship of the griffon gods were now forbidden, and the only god griffons were allowed to worship was the Frost King – the one who had punished them for their wickedness and weakness, and the one who would now rule over them for eternity. In an ultimate show of superiority over defeated griffons, pony warriors started desecrating temples of the Trinity and burning them to the ground. As once ponies had bested their own weak deities, now they would do the same with griffon ones.\nSuch acts of sacrilege were met with a nearly immediate response: griffon rebels rose up all around the country to protect their places of worship – and all across the Heartlands griffon priests called for holy war."

Occasional fights with pony warriors and harsh weather took their toll on the knights, unprepared for the brutality of the northern lands. Yet they persisted. On this particular day, strong winds prevented them from flying, and so they had to march through a cold marshy forest. All the remaining knights were battered and weakened by weeks of arduous travel. Finally, the last in line, who had been lagging behind for many days, after being wounded in battle, collapsed on the ground. The group stopped, but after a quick examination of his fallen brother Erik commanded,\n“Take his supplies and leave him. We cannot be delayed.”\n“But Grandmaster,” spoke up one of the knights.\n“No ‘buts’. Our mission is greater than the life of any one of us. We are to enter the heart of darkness and strike down the nemesis to save our kin,” proclaimed Grimclaw.\n“At least we should leave him some food. He still may catch up with us!”\nErik advanced on the dissident, speaking in a bellowing voice, “Don’t you see that he is already dead? He doesn’t need his food anymore.”\nHarrowed knights quietly took all the useful things off their fallen comrade, and left him to his own fate. For many hours after, no one spoke a single word..."

And when pony warriors finally prevailed, the Frost King ordered them to destroy all the grandiose symbols of the Empire in the city. And so the northern horde pillaged the Imperial Palace – and soon after, other landmarks followed. Noble mansions were looted, temples were razed to the ground, and monuments were bombed. However when ponies assaulted the Grand Temple of Boreas, the population of the city, which they thought had been beaten into submission, rose up. Hundreds of thousands took up arms and fought back – with the entire city soon falling into complete anarchy. Fires ignited by ponies came out of control, consuming entire districts, with no one to quell them. Perhaps for the first time, both the revolutionaries and the imperial loyalists fought side by side against the foreigners who seeked to destroy the heart of Griffonia. After three days of brutal clashes with griffon militias, pony warriors largely retreated from the ruined city, leaving it to the rebels. Nevertheless, chieftains reassure us that we will soon be able to reclaim Griffenheim, and punish the griffons for their impudent resistance."

And now history repeated itself – with Herzland occupied by foreign invaders, all able-bodied griffons flocked to Scheisswald – not seeking permanent residence, but a staging ground for an uprising.\nA small cabin located in the deep woods – once a bandit shelter – was filled with griffon leaders. Former imperial brass, Bluhm’s rebel commanders, a few priests, and headmasters of defeated knightly orders... It took Hector Andersson a lot of effort to gather them all here – and to prevent infighting. Even in the face of a common threat, most kept to their own groups, suspiciously eyeing others.\n“Brothers and sisters... friends,” Hector started the meeting. “I’m grateful to all who agreed to arrive here and put aside their differences...”\n“Let’s not be that hasty!” Interrupted a griffon in a Reichsarmee captain’s uniform.\nThe crowd started rumbling, but Hector continued, “In these trying times we must cooperate...”\n“Yea, just look at how cooperative they are,” snarked a griffon wearing a red bandana.\n“Cooperating with you would be treason!” shouted another former imperial officer.\nHector stopped the brewing argument with a loud bang of his armoured fist hitting a nearby table,\n“Quiet, everyone! This,” he held up a finger and continued, “Is exactly why we are here, and our homes are burning. We warriors keep bickering, while pony brutes pillage our cities and murder civilians. Yes, we used to be enemies, but now we are all in this together. If we continue fighting each other, soon we’ll have nothing to fight over. You’ve seen what this Frost King and his monsters do. Armies of undead, dark magic... You’ve heard stories from refugees about slavery, oppression, and genocide happening in the North. When we fled, leaving Griffenheim behind, Its citizens rose up to defend their city. They did not argue over politics, they fought, and they pushed the invaders out. If we continue doing nothing, ponies will return to finish them off. Griffenheim will fall for good, and the reign of terror will continue. Divided we will die, united we can win. We are few, but our enemy is overextended and thus, vulnerable. Now is our one last chance to strike. Only together can we liberate Herzland.”\nA long silence came over the crowd when Hector stopped talking. Finally, a vocal imperial officer declaimed,\n“Ardensson, me and my griffons are with you. For Herzland!” His pledge of allegiance was soon followed by countless others – from loyalists and rebels alike."

Supply caravans and groups of volunteers from all over Griffonia are crossing our borders, while rebels break into concealed arms depots of the Reichsarmee that we had failed to fully defeat. All this makes a counteroffensive on Griffenheim impossible, as we have to reorganise our forces and prepare to repel the insurrection, which is a much bigger threat than starving and poorly armed citizens of Griffenheim."

 ntribes.39.t:0 "The Cause"
 ntribes.39.d:0 "This time Grimclaw’s crew found refuge in a small, half-ruined, hut – probably a hunter’s cabin, abandoned years ago for reasons unknown to griffons – not that they cared to find out. Only half a dozen of Argentumdämmerung knights remained, and they no longer even resembled proud griffon warriors. Wounded, dirty, diseased, and malnourished, they looked like iron-clad bums. Yet they continued to trudge on towards “The Seat of Darkness” in Everfrost. Erik felt, however, that his companions had long ago lost faith in the success of their mission – and in his leadership. They were awfully silent when he was around, they seemed to avoid him.\nThe sun was setting – it was time to move out. \n“We must resume the march. We are close,” said Erik and rose from the floor. None of his companions followed. After a brief moment of silence, one of them said quietly,\n“You repeat it every day. Every day ‘We are close’. And what? Everfrost is nowhere to be seen, and more of us just keep dying. We should have stayed in Katerin, Erik, and fought for its griffons, not go on this mad quest.”\n“That would help no-one. We need to strike at the source of evil. Killing this self-proclaimed god will put an end to the war. Now move, there is no time for pointless discussions,” explained Erik.\n“Screw you!” responded the knight, losing his temper. “I’m going back home. Your madness has consumed enough good griffons, and I’m not going to be its next victim!” and started moving to the exit. \n“I will not tolerate treason!” half-said, half-screamed Grimclaw and unsheathed his sword. “You all swore fealty to me; you must obey my orders!” In response, the knight drew his own weapon and faced his Headmaster.\n“I reject your authority, Erik, you destroyed Argentumdämmerung – and all we believed in. You ordered us to slaughter villagers, to steal food, to abandon our brothers. You do not deserve to lead us!”\nWith a wild scream, Erik charged. Enraged, he was quick – too quick for a weakened knight to parry. Even though the first attack was enough to kill his target, he continued to slash the lifeless body. And when he finally came to his senses, he realised he was now alone – all the others ran away during the fight."

Another large revolt took place in Romau, with thousands joining the liberation armies – and we were forced to retreat further North. What is worse, our magic seems to have weakened, as the rebels are often found to be unaffected by it, fighting our undead warriors with truly unnatural vigor, as if the griffon gods themselves decided to support their faithful servants."

For a city untouched by war, it was awfully quiet, as if all its denizens had left with the armies of the Frost King.\nGuards of the Royal Palace paid no attention to him. The probability of an enemy getting this far North was truly miniscule – and even then, how could a mere mortal kill a god? Erik quickly climbed the castle walls, hurled himself onto the other side, and glided to a balcony of the palace proper. The interior the vast structure, once decorated with ornate reliefs and paintings depicting the history of northern ponies, was now covered in solid ice – often forming weird... unnatural shapes. There was no one inside, and Erik walked the corridors, hearing only the sound of his steps. He was here for the first time, yet somehow he knew where he should head.\nThe Frost King occupied the old Hall of Gatherings – now turned into his throne room. Undead guards stepped aside as Erik entered the chamber, granting him passage. The Frost King himself sat on an elaborate icy throne – an elderly pony, so frail in comparison to the grandiose hall – yet Erik sensed the immense power emanating from him. \n“Welcome, Erik Grimclaw, Grandmaster of a fallen order. I was waiting for you,” said the pony warmly.\n“Waiting? You knew I’d come?” \n“Yes, of course I did. Here, in my domain, few things escape my sight. I must say, I’m... impressed. You exceeded any expectations I had.” The Frost King smiled slightly. “Griffons are such miserable beings, so weak that they may seem worthless... Yet you rose beyond the limits of your race.”\n“Miserable? Weak?” said Erik, incredulous. Then, in a rising voice, exclaimed, “But here I stand before you, the one who will destroy you and free griffons from tyranny.”\n“You could try that. But first, answer this: are griffons worthy of being freed? Your companions, cowards and weaklings, have failed you. They were supposed to be the best of the best. They had a mission, a purpose. And still, they faultered. Time after time, century after century, countless griffons fought each other for naught. I took a few northern ponies, those you laughed at, – and under my command, they conquered the City of Emperors. They proved to be strong, and now they rule in my name. The weak do not deserve mercy or freedom – they exist only to be ruled. I deem you strong. Join me, and you shall be elevated above your worthless kin to be one of my champions. Join me, and become one of the new rulers of griffonkind.\nErik Grimclaw drew his sword..."

Many things motivate the pony army to push forward, while the undead are driven purely by the will of their lord. \nMeanwhile, the griffon rebels rise en masse, ready for their final fight. If they lose, they will forever be slaves of winter, oppressed and crushed. Priests bless the squads of volunteers marching to the front, and in a rare display of unity, it seems that the entirety of Griffonia is for once supporting – even if only vocally – the Herzlanders’ fight for freedom."

And so they did – city after city, village after village, ponies pushed South, leaving behind them a trail of destruction. It was only a matter of time before the resistance would be broken, and griffons firmly put under the hoof of northern invaders.\nErik faintly remembered this place, a small town in Katerin. He must have visited it in the past – not that it really mattered now. It was yet another place to be pacified, before his new subordinates – a combination of the undead, pony warriors, and few, clawpicked by him, griffon renegades would march forward. The job seemed straightforward – skirmishers who had arrived a few hours before seemed to have already finished off the defenders, as the group moved in unhindered. However... it was too quiet, and soldiers were nowhere to be seen. The number of bodies was also surprisingly small, as if the locals escaped. An ambush? As the group marched deeper into the town, some more dead griffons and ponies were discovered, but except for scavenger birds, the place was deserted. Finally, they reached the town square. The place was covered with corpses: both griffons and ponies. Among the boides clad in gilded armour lay the last survivor – an old, wounded griffon knight, stood leaning against the wall, a pool of blood slowly growing beneath him. Seeing the advancing group, he shouted,\n“Grimclaw! I hoped you died, hoped that these rumours about you commanding undead abominations were slander. Tell me... Why? Why did you betray your brothers, your gods, and your kin? I always knew you were a power-hungry bastard, but I never thought you’d stoop so low.”\n“Griffons deserve to be crushed, Hector, to be punished for their weakness.” Erik raised his arms. “We were all just deluding ourselves, thinking we might have a better future, that there is some divine plan for us. Even if there was, it failed. The cycle never stops, endlessly, the same thing: griffons fighting griffons – and nothing comes out of it. New fools come to power in a neverending fight for scraps. Cowards, fools, and traitors. All of you.”\n“You are mad. I do not know what happened to you, but you are nothing but a pathetic shell of yourself. You are the fool, deluding himself that the griffon spirit can be crushed. You are the coward, siding with monstrosities. You are the traitor of griffonkind.”\n“This conversation bores me.” Erik’s angered tone clearly contrasted his words. “Tell me where are the rest of the rebels and don’t try to delay me.”\n“There are none. I am the last one... Ah, you mean the civilians? They left long ago. We were just meant to distract your butchers, so they could get away from here. No more blood for you today.” Erik raised his claw, giving a sign to his bodyguards, who raised their guns.\n“Now what? You’ll order to shoot me?” Ardennson mocked him. “The great champion of death, fearing to fight a lone, wounded, old griffon?”\nErik cracked. Not even trying to contain his anger, he charged forward, screaming. What happened then wasn’t a fight – it was an execution. With Hector barely able to raise his sword, Grimclaw decapitated him in a single hit. For a few seconds he stood over the headless corpse, breathing heavily. When he turned around, his companions – those who were alive – flinched at his maniacal expression."

 ntribes.65.d:0 "Last few months have been nothing but a bloody nightmare. Ever since the northern savages came here, aided by undead monsters and dark magic, Aquileia has been turning into one giant graveyard. Cities were pillaged, villages set ablaze at the slightest show of resistance, temples burnt to the ground. Yet the worst was yet to come. Although particularly rabid warriors always tended to target local ponies, almost out of nowhere came a new order – “Kill them all.” Every pony in Aquileia is to be killed, none are to be left alive.\nSilver Tail was lucky to have escaped a few hours before northerners came to his town again. First time they sacked his shop and beat him until he passed out. And now, even from his hideout in a nearby forest, he could hear the screams of his compatriots being murdered. All he could do was to run away. He traveled mostly by night, hoping to not get caught.\nYet, after days of fear and hunger, he finally lost his caution and walked directly into a trap. Three masked and armed griffons were well-hidden among the trees and jumped him out of nowhere. Silver Tail heard about griffon traitors, who sometimes assisted the invaders. Resigned beyond the point of willingness to resist, the pony just stood, waiting for the shot... that never came.\n“He doesn’t look like a stray scout,” said one of the griffons, which, as Silver Tail noticed, wore remnants of the Aquileian army uniform. “We’re lucky that we didn’t listen to you,” he scolded the other partisan, “and did not shoot this one. What next, Guillame? Will you mistake a cow for a tank? This one is unarmed, unarmoured, and wears no bone trinkets every one of these maniacs has.”\n“The better question is, what will we do with him?” responded the one called Guillame, “We can’t just leave him here – the hunters will surely catch him. And the nearest evac point for refugees is far away.”\n“True, it's a death sentence. Hey you, don’t stand there like a stone statue. You’re going with us!”\n“But... where?” Silver Tail finally managed to stutter some words, “They are everywhere... They will kill me, kill you... There is nowhere to run.”\n“Heh, keep saying that, and it may just come true. Come on. The road is long, but we’ll get you out of here. There are smugglers on the coast, helping ones like you get beyond the sea. It will take a few weeks, but we’ll get there for sure. You are not the first pony we managed to rescue."

While the army of the Tyranny continues its purge, thousands of survivors are arriving in New Mareland, mostly thanks to the help of griffon smugglers. It is our duty to help these poor ponies, and we cannot turn our back to their plight.

Armies of the Frost King stopped, and beyond some magical bombardments meant to eliminate pockets of griffon soldiers, ponies seemed to be content with just surrounding and isolating Griffonstone. Although many griffons escaped into the mountains, the city was still filled with both locals and numerous refugees who hoped that gods would protect the holy city from invaders.\nErik Grimclaw observed the unfolding ‘spectacle’ from one of the advanced positions. He was sent here per order of the Frost King to ‘oversee’ the destruction of the city, although when he arrived, most preparations were already done by acolytes present on site. Now it has begun. Batteries of artillery started firing incendiary shells in unison with hundreds of mages, unleashing all the magical power they could muster. Bursts of magical flames followed more conventional heavy ordnance to the base of the ancient tree. The city was engulfed in flames, and quickly turned into a giant torch. Even from a distance, Erik could observe hundreds of griffons who had survived the initial bombardment and tried to escape from the doomed city by flight getting shot out of the sky by waves of spells. Yet despite the apocalyptic power of artillery and northern sorcery, the tree still stood in a final act of defiance. As if in a bloody frenzy, perhaps feeling the anger of their master, mages strained to summon all the power they could. But something was wrong... Even Erik could feel it – there was something incoming, as he could nearly feel the air vibrate. Suddenly, with a loud crack, the tree snapped in half, its upper part collapsing into the Great Abyss below. Moments later, earth started to shake, and all the northern mages started to scream in terror. Power they had used was now turning against them: an unparalleled magical cataclysm in the form of a wave of flames coupled with an earthquake came over the sorcerers – moments later consuming the entire northern camp. Erik survived only thanks to his distant location away from the rest of the army. Yet even he could only cower in terror, hoping for the calamity to end... And deep in his heart, hoping for it to kill him as well. After a few horrifying minutes, it all suddenly ended. All that was left were miserable remnants of a once powerful army and burning remnants of Griffonstone.\nErik just stood there in silence, looking as the tree continued to burn.

And so, Erik Grimclaw found himself in Gryphusian mountains – one of the last griffon holdouts to be conquered. For years now, he had just marched from one battle to another, having nothing else in his ‘life’, but this endless bloodshed and a hope to forget everything... or perhaps, a hope of finally being slain in combat? And so he lived, a wretch, longing for death. It seemed that the Frost King had lost interest in his servant a long time ago – and so he was left stranded with just a few of his renegade knights, who, like him, had nowhere else to go. It was truly over. Griffons were defeated, and their future was one of subservience to the mad God of the North. And Erik has had a part in this, having led armies of the Frost King. Now finding himself abandoned in the far reaches of Griffonia. Truly it was the most fitting punishment for his hubris. Being forgotten, discarded like a broken tool.\nAll Erik did these days was just gaze into the distant horizon, and reminisce about the past. There was nothing else left to him, he was a griffon who deserved no future, and wouldn’t have any. Not much different from undead monsters he used to command – feeling nothing, just following orders of their dark master... And now the orders stopped coming.\nIt was a day not different from others before. His remaining subordinates got used to their commander's ‘routine’, busying themselves with extorting food from locals, excercising their power by right of beings the northern tyrant’s pawns. It was only when Grimclaw did not return to the camp late in the evening, that a few of them came to check the seaside cliff where he spent most of his days. All that they found was his sword – discarded in a nearby patch of grass. Grimclaw was nowhere to be seen, and frankly, none of them really cared about it. While in the following years some would report sightings of a white-haired griffon in rags, wandering nearby mountains and forests, his existence became – in time – completely forgotten: his life, early accomplishments, and later betrayal were lost to the time..."

It was his ultimate triumph. The rest of the world would cower in terror and find only solace in hope that he would never come for them. Maybe one day he would, but for now he was more than enjoying their fear. The revenge was far from done yet – it would never truly be done – as he could continue to torment griffons for eternity. The reign of the Frost King shall last until the end times, until the sun fades, and all that remains of this world is ice and darkness.\nAnd yet, from time to time, listening to reports of his acolytes and warlords, the Frost King felt annoyed. It seemed that griffons never knew when to give up. Every now and then there was another rebellion, another group of fools rose up in a misguided attempt to oppose him. And each time he sent his servants to crush them – and each time they succeeded, as they had before. And yet, after some time, the cycle would start anew. Well, at least it kept his servants from becoming completely complacent. But somewhere deep within the Frost King a new feeling was born – one he had never felt until now."

While the grasp of invaders over this land was weaker than in the earlier years, they were still quite dangerous. And as their control dwindled, ponies and their undead servants were growing more and more brutal. The place where the rebels met was nothing more than an old basement beneath a ruined district of the city, but throughout the years they turned it into one of their many bunkers, storing weapons, digging out emergency exit tunnels, and setting traps. The locals were an unpleasant bunch of bandits and run-away, half-crazed slaves. And yet, even these wretched parodies of griffons still held some respect for these who fought against the Tyrant – still, one could never know when they might try to steal the weapons they managed to gather. Traps were therefore a sound idea, protecting the rebels not from their enemy, but from themselves.\nHere in the main bunker they met to plan the actions of their respective cells. It took some time before disparate groups of partisans started to cooperate, but now that they were finally united, there came a steady flow of new members. It would be a long time before they could engage the invaders directly – but every day they picked off stragglers and distant outposts, harassed slavers and liberated labour camps. Every day they continued to fight – some of them have never stopped ever since the Great War. No matter their former allegiances, their goal was the same – liberation. Veterans of old conflicts: former Reichsarmee soldiers, ideological republicans, and griffons who had fought for all manner of armies and governments everyone except them had forgotten about, continued to lead their guerrilla warfare and teach new generations of those who were already born under the yoke of Endless Winter. They told them about the glorious days of the past, about the iron-clad knights, virtuous protectors of griffonkind, about the opulence and majesty of the fallen Griffonian Empire, about the dreams of an equal, united Griffonia, about the gods who still surely watched over their children.

His grandchildren have long ago pushed forward, chasing each on the hilltop – as children do. A child’s energy is a thing adults learn to admire only when their breaths become short, and unfamiliar parts of the body start aching in the morning. Nevertheless, after a few more steps, the old griffon reached the hilltop and sat down heavily on the ground. The sight was truly worth a lengthy climb, Lake Rumare looked beautiful this time of year: blue, clean water reflected small farms and vineyards along its shore, separated by patches of woodland – truly a sight to behold. And in the distance, he could see the spire of the broken Tower – one of many that once dominated the lands of Griffonia. Now, broken many years ago, remnants of its spire lay around the ruined megalithic structure, it resembled more of a small island. Every time he looked at it, he felt a mixture of fear of the days long past, and pride of the day when the tower had been felled. They fought their entire way to it, fighting more and more deranged pony warriors and such beasts that not even Maar himself could unleash. And yet they pushed forward, knowing that victory was near.

She took the shiny rock I found!” Youngest of his grandchildren was pulling him by the lily on the cuff of his old coat, almost screaming into his ear, “I found this rock, and she took it!” \n“Aerm, what?” he was utterly confused, having been pulled out of his memories so suddenly. “A rock? Can’t you find a new one? There are plenty of nice ones around!” \n“Nooo! This one was mine!” The chick ran towards his sister, who started running away, triumphantly holding up the contested pebble.\n“Get back here, you little rascals!” Grandpa got up from the ground and followed the youngsters, hoping to catch them. If their parents could not make them behave, it was up to him to teach the children to stop fighting over every little thing...\nBehind him, the sun was slowly setting behind the broken Tower. For a brief moment, lake Rumare’s waters looked like blood in the setting sun’s red light, only to later return to their normal, blue, colour. Somewhere in the grass crickets started to chirp."

 ntribes.104.t:0 "A Cold Night in Everfrost"
 ntribes.104.d:0 "Cold wind was blowing through the ice fortress once known as Everfrost. The shrieking it made when it pressed against the ice could instantly freeze one's blood. The scream of a banshee was nothing in comparison. Yet to those who lived here nowadays it was almost a pleasurable sound, that of oncoming death. Yet today, one local could not sleep well because of it.\nThe cold sweat beads were running down the dreamer's forehead. His dreams were unfocused, and he was coming in and out of them, waking up often. The dreams of that which had been aeons ago, the hopes, rises and falls, betrayals, the goals of those who've been forgotten by time.\nAnd now a new dream took hold. It was hard to make out the details or whom it might have belonged to. A young colt, no more than fourteen, was sitting in a cave. He was wearing a fur coat to protect him from the cold while practising the magicks he has learned. Only a bit of his ginger locks was showing. So concerned with his magic, that he failed to notice another entering the cave until a hoof slapped his shoulder. \n“Wooow, you've made so much progress again!” Said the bubbly voice belonging to a filly, no older than the colt, in front of him. Before he could say anything she clasped his hoof and pulled him towards the entrance. “Let's go play outside. It is so pretty today.” He finally managed to pull his hoof out of hers. “I don't have time for playing I need to master my magic as soon as possible. I will definitely protect the village and show them just what I can do.” He declared as he always did. “Ah, you are hopeless. What am I gonna do with you, you're always so serious,” she said teasingly.\n“And you will get sick if you keep walking around with no coat,” he pointed out.\n“Now you sound like my dad.” She pouted. But she hasn't given up yet. She kept talking and bothering him as so many days before, until he would give up, “Fine, but only five minutes.”\nFor whatever reason, the dreamer felt happy when witnessing these events. The fuzzy feeling at the edges of the consciousness, keeping away the darkness of what could have been. \nThe dream changed again. The spicy wind immediately hit the dreamer's eyes. It was hard to keep them open with all the ash, smoke, and fire around. The dreamer was standing amid a burning village. Scattered bodies of ponies and griffon raiders were all around. The aftermath of a battle. Wailings of those who remained were coming from all directions. The dreamer noticed one particular person, upon a closer look, he recognized the colt from the cave, albeit somewhat older. He was crying and holding onto the body of his friend. The filly that pestered him so much. However, now her body was weak and limp in his embrace. Her belly was cut open. “No, you can't leave me! You are my only friend.” The colt whimpered pleadingly. “You... protect the village... I am sure... they now understand.” Her words were weak as if coming from a great distance. “You remember that...” The colt was surprised she would bring up something so embarrassing now. “I will always be with you. So please smile, Ga...vin...” Her voice fell silent at last, and only the wailing of the wind remained."

 ntribes.105.t:0 "Servitude in Death"
 ntribes.105.d:0 "The railway crew was about to reach the foothills of the great northern mountains. It was then that the first workers started to drop dead. This did not bother their overseers, and soon dead griffons rose again to join their still living comrades. After this, a few griffs not yet broken by hunger, exhaustion, and fear, tried to make an escape...\nNext day, their lifeless bodies were displayed on stakes along the railway to “motivate” the others.\nAs they went through the mountains of Brantbeak, raising bridges and mining tunnels, more and more griffs died – and then their undead bodies crumbled from endless work, their bones finally breaking. Entire groups of griffon labourers were swept away from cliffsides by avalanches or crushed by falling rocks. And yet, their work continued. The few griffons unfortunate enough to stay alive looked barely different from their undead comrades – just haunted shells of their former selves, mindlessly chipping away rocks from one mountain after another.\nGeorg hated himself for his cowardice, his fear of death – and what would happen after it. He continued his servitude, until he was the only griffon left alive. And one day they reached the final mountain on their route. They were nearing Silkhorn – the end point of their journey – now clearly visible from their elevation, and farther in the distance Georg could see the beautiful green valleys of the Heartlands.\nThe lovely sight brought dread to Georg's mind. Something wasn’t right about this. He looked around.\nHundreds of griffon husks laid down rails while columns of undead warriors marched ahead, flying the Frost King banners. A revelation hit Georg's mind. Now he clearly saw what kind of future he helped bring... He stood there for a moment, frozen. Before his eyes flashed the pictures of countless innocent griffons – now slaves to the Frost King – being packed into trains, running on rail tracks he’d planned and seen built. Shame was too complex an emotion for his mind overwhelmed by immense terror at the thought of what was to come. Without thinking, Georg dashed to the closest breach and launched himself into a nosedive along the cliff, keeping his wings folded. He should have done this long ago. He had to end it.\nNo one tried to stop him. Nobody even looked."
 ntribes.105.a:0 "He was no longer needed."
 ntribes.106.t:0 "Servitude in Life"
 ntribes.106.d:0 "It was unthinkable to Georg that becoming a railway engineer would one day save his life. Until it happened – twice. First, when he had to leave Skynavia to inspect a section of tracks south of the city. Even miles away, Georg and his companions could see enormous clouds gathering around the city, feeling something... unnatural. Then the snowstorm hit them and rail started to crack under the cold. Georg ran like hell, barely escaping freezing to death. In the following chaos, his railway crew was captured by advancing pony warriors and put into a slave camp. Really, “camp” was a generous term for the colony of dugouts griffons had to expand with their bare claws and simplest tools, punished for the slightest show of disobedience. Warriors didn’t even bother to deliver punishment themselves – they delegated that to their accompanying undead abominations. Their captors barely bothered feeding the slaves, but their tenure in the camp was rather brief. Ponies had plenty of jobs in mind for their newly acquired labourers: some were sent to dismantle the ruins of Skynavia, many more to toil in mines. Overseers gave one chance to those who possessed valuable skills to reveal themselves, and Georg was among the few engineers who hesitantly did so. No doubt, the soulless monsters these ponies had become, had sinister intent, but he was willing to help them in order to stay alive and fed.\nThe Frost King needed an army – and even an army of undead required logistics. They needed railroads to deliver their guns and ammo – railroads that Georg would design, and other griffon captives would build.\nSo began their descent into Tartarus.\nAt first they cleared their way through vast northern forests, building a great railway from the pony capital of Everfrost, its sinister crystal spires shining behind them. Skynavian griffons, hardened by years of life and war in the North, toiled hard under the silent gaze of their overseers – some alive, some not. There was something wrong with these ponies. The eyes of the living were as empty as those of the undead, as if they’d lost something, and the only emotions they displayed were anger and hatred to the griffonkind. Sometimes at night they sang in their weird language, of which Georg barely understood a few words. They were songs of loss, abandonment... and promised revenge."

 ntribes.108.d:0 "In a rather surprising turn of events, we have been visited by a pony diplomat from Northern Griffonia. It seems that these ‘northern ponies’ managed to create a modern, fully functional state, and even conquer some griffon lands. Now however, facing our might, they are willing to join us vassals and swear fealty as long as they’re allowed to self-govern. Shall we accept their offer or reconquer the northern reaches of the Empire? Of course, we can also demand the return of all the griffon lands they have previously conquered and let them keep the northern wastelands."

 ntribes.114.t:0 "Gone to the Dogs"
 ntribes.114.d:0 "The situation that Grover ended up in was... weird. After taking Griffenheim, these strange pony warriors did not assault his residence. Rather, their chieftains started long and tense negotiations with the remaining Barkingians, still guarding the imperial palace. Ever since that started, envoys have been travelling to and from the palace almost daily. After many weeks passed, the commander of the Barkingian Guard, looking heartbroken, informed the young Emperor that the last pony envoy delivered an ultimatum: Grover was to renounce his claim to the Imperial Throne in return for being appointed as the Count of Bronzehill. The old dog begrudgingly suggested accepting this offer, as there was seemingly no hope for the arrival of any help.\nAnd now, Grover was leaving his home to probably never return to it. He tried to look as dignified as possible, surrounded by Barkingians, wearing their gala uniforms. The procession was overseen by a group of ponies, wearing weird tribal outfits. Among them, a pink-maned mare – as Grover heard, ruler of the Northerners. She took a melancholic look at Grover, saying said a few words in a weird, unintelligible language. A blue-coated pegasus, standing next to her, translated in heavily accented Herzlandish,\n“The Princess expresses her sadness that your rule had to end like this. She was also once forced to watch her nation be plunged into chaos, being too young to rule and unable to do anything. She hopes that you will find peace and won’t have to endure what happened to us. It is unfortunate that fate brought this upon us.”\nGrover left towards the station, where a train to Bronzehill waited for him, even more puzzled than before."

It is becoming more and more difficult to manage such a vast and diverse nation. While Evefrost is the traditional capital of the Tribes and the biggest northern pony settlement, it is simply too far North to allow for efficient administration. Perhaps we should move our capital South, to Cloudbury. There we would both have an easier time managing our United Kingdom and show some goodwill to the griffons. Of course, whatever place we choose, it will surely witness rapid growth, as our subjects will arrive in the new capital en masse..."

 ntribes.119.d:0 "Being a ruler – an actual ruler, and not someone’s puppet or a hoof-waving “symbol of unity” means a lot of work. The good side of it was that it kept Fiana busy, keeping the dark thoughts and fears away. There was always some public figure requesting an audience, a decision to be made, a Very Important Festival to attend... However, now with the griffon problem solved, everything calmed down. After years of hard work, one day Fiana found herself lacking anything even remotely important to do. There was not a single dispute among the clans, none of her subordinates asked for orders... Peace and quiet. She roamed the palace for some time, distracting servants, until finally settling down in one of the greenhouses to rest a bit. Gardens of the Snowflake Palace were one of its many wonders: merchants brought many exotic and beautiful plants from the South, which were then cultivated here. Thanks to pony magic and mastery of the glassblowers, these amazing structures supported various warmth-loving fauna alive in the harsh climate of the North.\nWhen Fiana was a filly, she spent a lot of time in these gardens, playing out adventures in the mysterious southern lands, trekking through vast jungles and exploring lost temples, like in one of the books she found in the palace’s library. Those were the simpler times... Alas, they were never meant to last.\nThese few years of tireless work on her realm sparked a feeling within Fiana that wasn’t there before; a sense of purpose, a desire to protect her kin. Was this what her father Fothad felt when he led his fellow ponies to battle griffons? She instinctively rebounded from that thought, but soon found that there was nothing wrong about it. Her fears and regrets that followed here ever since her family died were gone. For the first time in her life, she felt free, powerful."

 ntribes_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The northern reaches of Griffonia have been ignored by most. Considered a frozen wasteland, where nothing of interest can be found. However, after defeating the Skynavian griffons, local ponies apparently fell under control of a mysterious cult led by the so-called “Frost King” – and started their genocidal campaign against griffons in the Griffonian South. Hordes of tribal warriors, accompanied by the undead, and utilising dark magic conquered many griffon nations, slaughtering all who resisted, and enslaving the rest. But this was not the end of the Frost King’s ambitions, as he has somehow managed to absorb the power of the Northern Spirits, becoming what some describe as a demigod able to rival equestrian alicorns. Probably all the mages in the world could feel the effects of this event – and were horrified by them. Few know what happens in the so-called Tyranny of Ice, but rumors and testimonies of refugees show it as a nightmarish warmongering state, whose leader is driven solely by revenge over griffonkind."

### Decisions ###
NTR_spirits_blessings_cat:0 "Magic of the Spirits"
 NTR_spirits_blessings_cat_desc:0 "Spirits of the North have guided their chosen tribes since times immemorial. However in these dire days, a more direct intervention is needed. Our druids must try to reach directly to the Six Spirits and ask for their help. First, we’ll have to convince each of the blessed clans to lend us their help in contacting the Spirits. Then, channeling their powers will be an exhausting task for mortal bodies of our druids. We can ask for only one blessing at a time."
 NTR_metal_bless:0 "Blessing of §gMetal§!"

 NTR_earth_bless:0 "Blessing of §8Earth§!"

 NTR_water_bless:0 "Blessing of §2Water§!"

 NTR_ice_bless:0 "Blessing of §0Ice§!"
 NTR_ice_bless_desc:0 "Some say that the North remembers everything – and the memories lie within its eternal ice."
 NTR_dark_magic_cat:0 "Dark Magic"
 NTR_dark_magic_cat_desc:0 "Thanks to the pact with the Blizzard Kings, we gained knowledge long-forgotten, the art of not just petty necromancy, but of capturing natural magic that flows through the North and using it for our benefits. The North is a land of magical spirits, and though they have become distant, their power can still be felt – and can be used. No longer shall we beg the spirits for help. We will bend their magic to serve our goals. Of course, this may cause certain... disturbances."
 NTR_raise_dead_dc:0 "Raise the Dead"
 NTR_raise_dead_dc_desc:0 "Northern Ponies have frozen their dead in ice vaults for hundreds of years. As a result, millions of corpses are kept in immense permafrost cemeteries – an endless source of potential soldiers for our army."

 NTR_unnatural_insight:0 "Unnatural Insight"
 NTR_unnatural_insight_desc:0 "By reading our enemies’ minds, we will uncover all the secrets that they hide from us."
 NTR_ritual_dc:0 "Start the Ritual"
 NTR_ritual_dc_desc:0 "We have finished the preparations to destroy New Skynavia. The destructive powers we will unleash should be more than enough to get rid of Skynavians once and for all. However, such a powerful spell will take time to be properly cast, and Skynavian mages will without a doubt feel a great disturbance in the magical aether – Skynavians will do all they can to stop us."
 NTR_knowledge_quest_cat:0 "Quest for Knowledge"

 NTR_smuggling_cat:0 "Smuggling Opportunities"
 NTR_smuggling_cat_desc:0 "Few legitimate merchants enter our realm – the perils of travelling along the Northern Passage are enough to scare off even the bravest of captains, while harsh weather and high mountains prevent easy land travel from the South. Yet, griffons are greedy creatures, and some were always desperate enough to take the risk of travelling North. Our feathered ‘partners’ have some interesting offers for us..."
 NTR_purchase_bakaran_artillery:0 "Purchase Bakaran Artillery"
 NTR_purchase_bakaran_artillery_desc:0 "Yes, we are surprised too. How no-one notices the disappearance of a CANNON is a conundrum. But it's the riverponies’ problems, not ours."
 NTR_purchase_republican_guns:0 "Buy From Griffon Warlords"
 NTR_purchase_republican_guns_desc:0 "Griffonian Republic has been long plagued by various bandit groups. Some of them are more than happy to sell us (former) property of the republican government."
 NTR_purchase_imperial_guns:0 "Reichsarmee’s Surplus"
 NTR_purchase_imperial_guns_desc:0 "With chaos engulfing the Imperial Heartlands, lots of military equipment is getting displaced and ends up in the wrong claws. We know some griffons in Brantbeak, who can help us get our hooves on some imperial armaments."

 NTR_river_fed_honorary_member:0 "Honorary River Coalition Membership"
 NTR_river_fed_honorary_member_desc:0 "Years ago, eastern ponies formed the River Coalition in response to griffon aggression towards them. These events, in a way, mimic our situation. Riverlanders are quite similar to us, and could surely benefit from cooperation with us. Due to our distance from the Riverlands, joining the Coalition itself is not a realistic option, but perhaps we can pursue some closer ties with our eastern brothers and sisters nonetheless."
 NTR_contact_equestria:0 "Equestrian Cooperation"
 NTR_contact_equestria_desc:0 "Mighty Equestria, the birthplace of ponykind, without doubt, the greatest, most advanced, and richest nation in the world... At least so we heard. It is indisputable however that Equestria is a superpower dominating an entire continent. Their ideology of harmony and so-called “magic of friendship” is well-known outside the borders of their state, and many look towards Equestria for help and guidance. Perhaps we should ask them for assistance too..."
 NTR_liberate_np_cat:0 "Liberate Our Kin"
 NTR_liberate_np_cat_desc:0 "Many pony clans live in the lands south of Tir Deighe, under the rule of griffons. Now after defeating Skynavian invaders, time has come to unite all the northern ponies under the rule of their Princess. And if griffons dare to deny our rightful claims to these lands, we are ready to back up our demands with force!"

 NTR_demand_from_FAW:0 "Demand land from §YCloudbury§!"
 NTR_dark_tower_cat:0 "Construct the Towers"
 NTR_dark_tower_cat_desc:0 "Griffons have proven to be unruly and rebellious creatures. It is becoming more and more difficult to control millions of these pests, and as distance from Everfrost grows, our control weakens. To enforce our rule, a series of towers will be constructed. From them, loyal acolytes of the Frost King shall reign over the surrounding lands. Through powerful fortifications, spells built into the Towers, and sheer intimidation, we should be able to establish much firmer control over their immediate territories."
 NTR_aurora_tower:0 "Aurora Tower"
 NTR_aurora_tower_desc:0 "The old palace of Snowflakes has been the Frost King’s residence ever since his reign over Tir Deighe began. Time has come to expand it, creating a structure worthy of the true God of the North. Aurora Tower, a gigantic spire made of magical ice and finest northern crystals will be a powerful monument to the Frost King’s power."
 NTR_iron_tower:0 "Iron Tower"
 NTR_iron_tower_desc:0 "Every day, thousands of slaves toil and die in Cloudbury’s workshops. From the Iron Tower, overseers will watch over them to guarantee a constant supply of weapons for our army. Metallic walls of the Tower will serve as a reminder of the new role of the once proud city of Cloudbury."
 NTR_black_tower:0 "Black Tower"
 NTR_black_tower_desc:0 "Raised among the charred ruins of the old capital of griffons, the Black Tower will forever remind griffons what fate awaits those who dare to revolt against the Frost King."
 NTR_shadow_tower:0 "Shadow Tower"
 NTR_shadow_tower_desc:0 "Darkness falls over the City of Lights. Aquila’s residents shall be put in chains to serve their new masters ‘till the end of time, living beneath the shadow of the newly raised Tower."
 NTR_blood_tower:0 "Blood Tower"
 NTR_blood_tower_desc:0 "The red-walled Blood Tower rises above the waters of Lake Rumare, once Cradle – now Grave – of Griffonkind. From it, acolytes of the Frost King secure our control of Central Griffonia."
 NTR_obsidian_tower:0 "Obsidian Tower"
 NTR_obsidian_tower_desc:0 "Over the marble buildings of the Eternal City, rises a black-walled fortress. The Obsidian Tower stands as a reminder that even the proudest of southern cities will eventually bow to the North."
 NTR_storm_tower:0 "Storm Tower"
 NTR_storm_tower_desc:0 "Our westernmost watchtower, the Storm Tower, stands as the first line of defence against any creature who would wish to invade Frost King’s realm. While it resembles a haunted ruin, with its structure composed primarily out of shipwrecks, it is nevertheless a powerful fortress like all other towers."
 NTR_amber_tower:0 "Amber Tower"
 NTR_amber_tower_desc:0 "Magical qualities of amber, sometimes called “Crystals of Evi”, have not been researched yet. However, with the abundance of this material, we shall use it to construct a tower-fortress to reign over Evi Valley."
 NTR_slave_mines_cat:0 "Expand Slave Mining Operations"
 NTR_slave_mines_cat_desc:0 "With our recent conquests, we have obtained vast quantities of griffon slaves. Time has come to use them more extensively to further fuel our war machine. Lots of lives will surely be lost, but we can always get more, so it's not a big problem."

 NTR_last_griffon_alliance_cat:0 "The Last Griffon Alliance"
 NTR_last_griffon_alliance_cat_desc:0 "Terrified of our growing power, griffons are apparently putting aside their differences and preparing for the final, apocalyptic conflict. Diplomats travel between capitals, alliances are being made, and war preparations are ongoing. If we do not act swiftly, we might face a unified front of the remaining griffon states, determined to fight us ‘till the bitter end."
 NTR_griffon_last_alliance:0 "Formation of the Alliance"
 NTR_frost_king_superhighway_cat:0 "Slave Railway Network"
 NTR_frost_king_superhighway_cat_desc:0 "Our army has grown to such an extent that it can no longer be supplied by carriages. Though undead soldiers require little to fight, constant loss of complex equipment in modern wars requires a robust supply system.\nThe way to achieve this lies in the construction of a train network, spanning the northern wastes. Luckily, we have plentiful workforce for this perilous task..."
 NTR_fks_1:0 "Connect §YEverfrost§! and §YOld Dragon§!"
 NTR_fks_1_desc:0 "Cutting through frozen tundra, the railway from the heart of our nation, Everfrost, to the distribution hub in Old Dragon will act as the main artery of the military supply system, from which the flow of our precious equipment will be directed to the frontlines."
 NTR_fks_2:0 "Connect §YOld Dragon§! and §YElf Lake§!"
 NTR_fks_2_desc:0 "Weaving between the frosty hills, the Old Dragon–Elf Lake railway allows our military to recieve reliable shipments of equipment from the Holy Forge manufacturies."

 NTR_fks_3_desc:0 "The mountainous terrain of Brantbeak will have to be conquered in order to supply the eastern front of the war against the Griffonian Empire. The Elf Lake–Silkhorn line will symbolise triumph of the Frost King over the Northern Spirits and undoubtedly will become one of the greatest achievements of ponykind."
 NTR_fks_4:0 "Connect §YOld Dragon§! and §YSquark§!"
 NTR_fks_4_desc:0 "As the main supply line for our invasion of the Griffonian Heartlands, a carefully planned route starting at Old Dragon, continuing against the mountain range of Lostgate and ending at Squark was chosen."

 NTR_claim_our_destiny_cat_desc:0 "Having conquered Cloudbury, the seat of power of the failed republican government, we came to rule masses of griffons who vastly outnumber the northern ponies.
