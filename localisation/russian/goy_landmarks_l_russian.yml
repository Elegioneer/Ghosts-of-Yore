landmark_goy_arantigos_grand_temple_desc:0 "A juggernaut of marble, gold and steel. Reaching three hundred meters high, the Grand Temple is the largest structure ever raised by griffons – a monument to piety and vainglory of the Regent of Arantiga. Its opressing presence over the ancient city of Karthin serves as a grim reminder of Arantigan rule over the south – and of single-minded dedication of arantigans to their god and emperor – Arantigos."

landmark_goy_snowflake_palace_desc:0 "The ancient Snowflake Palace was build many centuries ago, using the almost forgotten by now magical technique of shaping unique ice-crystals, old northern pony mages had mastered. Its six towers, meant to represent the Great Northern Spirits, soar high above the city of Everfrost, glistening in the sun. Over its many years of service as the primary residence of Tir Deighe's princely dinasty, countless treasures have accumulated in its vast vault, and its libraries got filled with tomes of arcane knowledge."
