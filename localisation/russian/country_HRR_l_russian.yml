## Events ##
herzland_liberation_goy.01.t:0 "The Fallen One"
 herzland_liberation_goy.01.d:0 "Everfrost stank of death and smoke – like any other city after a prolonged battle. And the battle for Everfrost was long. Pony warriors fought until the bitter end – either out of sheer hatred of griffons or in fear of their ruler's reprisal. Streets were littered with bodies of both the (recently) living and undead, and many districts had been levelled. However, amidst all the destruction, the Snowflake Palace stood unharmed, taunting griffons. All damage to the palace was nearly instantly repaired with magical ice. Frost King might have been cornered in his lair, but the attackers could not get to him. Every squad that entered the palace did not return. \nHector Ardensson stood in front of the gates. For days, first when he slept, now even during daytime he heard a voice. The Frost King was speaking in his head, taunting him and demanding that he come to face him. And though other commanders tried to dissuade him from going, Hector knew it was his duty. The old knight went through the remnants of the once intricate gates and entered the palace. The interior was covered in ice, forming all kinds of weird ornaments and sculptures. He did not know how long he had wandered through the corridors and empty rooms before coming by a large hall, inside of which stood a single creature – a griffon.\nErik Grimclaw seemed to be asleep, leaning on his sword with his head lowered. However as Hector approached, he spoke up, “Ardensson. The Frost King told me you would come. He was right, as always.”\n“When I was told that you were seen on the frontlines, leading undead monstrosities…” responded Hector scornfully, “I was in disbelief. I thought you had perished, and the Tyrant raised you, like so many others, as some cruel joke. But here you are. Alive. Why?” Erik was silent for a long moment, gazing off into space... “Griffons are weak. We just fight, trick, and betray each other. Do such miserable creatures really deserve freedom? For over thirty years griffons have been killing each other for petty reasons. You think something will change when you win? These weaklings will tear apart everything you’ve built.”\nHector drew his sword. “If we were like you say, I would not be here. Armies of your ‘king’ would not be defeated. We might seem weak, but inside every griffon is a spark, a potential for greatness. This spark shines brightest in the face of adversity. When we prevail, we’ll build a better Griffonia.”\nErik shrieked and jumped at Hector, raising his sword. His speed and strength were surprising even for a young griffon. The old knight, forced into frantic defence, felt his strength wane with every deflected strike. Erik’s assault was relentless, and Hector knew that he needed to finish this fight quickly. His only chance was to use Erik’s rage against him. Hector feigned a slip, and when Erik tried to strike him down, he managed to land a decisive stab. The fallen knight stopped abruptly and stared at the blade protruding out of his chest, moved a few steps backwards, and fell on the floor. The wound was obviously fatal. Hector took Erik’s sword and stood over him. The young knight closed his eyes, reconciled with his fate. With one clean strike, Hector cut his head off. “I can only hope gods will have mercy upon you, Erik,” he said at parting. There was now only one thing left..."

 herzland_liberation_goy.02.d:0 "The old Hall of Gatherings, now the Frost King’s throne room… The place resembled a slaughterhouse. Dozens of slain griffons covered the floor along with undead guards – most evidently killed by magic, rather than swords. The Tyrant of the North sat on his grandiose throne of ice. Even if he tried to be terrifying and regal, it was obvious that holding off artillery barrages and the battle of Everfrost took a heavy toll on him. Parts of his body were rotting, in some places to the bone, as if overuse of his magical powers was slowly destroying him.\nIt was almost a pitiful sight: a lone, self-proclaimed god, hiding in his palace, even his stolen powers betraying him… But Hector did not pity the creature that killed so many innocent souls – and wanted to enslave many more rest. “So, you have finally come. I guess, my pawn is dead then? I’m not really surprised, he was more of a talker than a fighter... But presumed he would at least wound you. What a disappointment.” Hector did not respond, just slowly approached the throne with his sword drawn. “No threats? No accusations? No calling the names of your pitiful gods, griffon? You are a knight, you should be all about honour and faith, talking about great things. I’m not amused.”\n“You deserve nothing but death, fiend!” said Hector and charged ahead. The pony raised his hoof slightly, as if he was bored by the scene. A wave of ice-cold air hit Hector, with a strength that would knock down an adult minotaur – and turn him into an ice sculpture moments later. Yet Hector shrugged it off like a gust of wind. Indifference in the eyes of the Frost King was replaced with surprise – and fear. Shards of ice rose from the floor, piercing Hector’s body, but he still continued his charge. Visibly desperate, the Frost King raised his hoof, and a sword-shaped icicle appeared in it. Ice hit steel... And steel shattered.\nHector fell on the floor, exhausted and weakened by his wounds. The Frost King stood in silence for a moment. And then started to laugh,\n“You fool!” he cackled, “you thought that you could kill me? That you could kill a god?!” He came forward and stood right over his defeated foe. “I will kill you. But not now. I want you to witness the moment when I unleash my wrath upon your pitiful comrades and...” At this moment Hector suddenly reached forward with his hand, tearing through the skin on the Frost King’s chest and grasping his icy heart. Before the sorcerer could react, Hector ripped it out of his chest, and hit it against the floor, shattering it. \nWith a ghastly scream, the Frost King collapsed, his body rapidly decaying, until nothing but few bones remained. Hector got up. First the heard trembling, then pieces of ceiling started falling around him – it was time to run. Despite his wounds, he dashed for the nearest exit. He barely escaped the palace, as moments after he got past the gates, it collapsed behind him. Hector gave it one last look. There were some griffons, running towards him and screaming... But he couldn’t hear what they were saying…"

Though some continued harassing our forces, death of their master soon somehow made them lose all will to fight. Many of those we had captured just sat and refused even food and drink. Nobody expected their morale to fall this low, and even our most battle-hardened soldiers started to pity these creatures. There are also many clansponies that did not have much to do with the events of the last years, continuing to live under the reign of Frost King the same as they always had, never hurting a griffon. They and many others are now at our mercy. Though some hotheads called for vengeance – as brutal as possible – Hector Ardensson, summoning all of his authority, convinced the other rebel leaders that instead of repeating the cycle of oppression that has led to this moment, what they needed now was forgiveness, and that griffons and ponies had to learn to live together without hatred and war. Still the question remained, what to exactly do with Tir Deighe – some suggested leaving the clans to their own devices, while others called for us keeping garrisons there, just in case ponies let loose some other ancient evil..."

The three archonates had held an important position in the Empire, and even now they continue to exert large influence over the newly formed state. However, with the creation of the Kingdom of Herzland, moderate nobles and republicans were unwilling to let the Three Temples return to their former positions of power. A debate then arose on how to limit the power of the Archonates: with some arguing that they should be made subservient to the crown and become essentially another way for the King to enforce his will, while others suggesting complete secularisation of the state, leaving the Temples to operate freely, while being forbidden from exerting influence over politics."

While many candidates were proposed, through careful political maneuvering and negotiations between the parties and other groups of influence only three have gathered enough support to be considered able to form a stable government, while also receiving tacit support from the Royal Army and influential nobles.\nFirst of them is Heinrich Kingfeather, who rose as a major figure in the restored National Republican Party. As a known moderate, he appealed to the more liberally-minded.\nThe second candidate, Winston Copperhill, is a favourite of the Herzlander loyalists, also supported by many republican-leaning griffons, – his candidature is the least divisive.\nThe last one, pushed through by influential nobility in government, is Regina Eagleclaw, a distant relative of our King and former Duchess of Strawberry. While being very well-connected with the elites, she receives the least popular support out of the three.\nAll Herzlanders are anxiously waiting to see which of the three candidates will be appointed by the parliament and approved by the King as the new Chancellor."

Of course, nothing in this is as simple as it might seem, and various factions are trying to shape the Kingdom according to their own beliefs and interests.\nRepublicans hope to firmly establish the parliament as the prime power of the Kingdom, strengthening the elected Chancellor and his subordinate apparatus, while limiting the influence of the King in all branches of government.\nRoyalists push for the King to have veto powers over any decision that the parliament makes and for expansion of the civil service, answerable directly to him.\nMeanwhile, various regional movements argue for decentralisation of the state and expanded legislative powers for individual provinces of the Kingdom."

In the last few weeks three major candidates emerged:\nGabriella di Karthin (who has recently distanced herself from the remnants of the National Republican Party), a former senator from Romau, she promised further democratisation of the Federation.\nHeinrich Kingfeather – an old republican politician from Cloudbury – ran on the platform of maintaining traditional values and empowering minorities. \nAnd Gerben Kogchel, a democratic socialist, who managed to rally together the varied and internally divided communist movements of Herzland."

While the common fight against the Frost King created a unique sort of unity that was beyond political allegiances, it was now becoming obvious that socialist revolutionaries and old imperial loyalists could not cooperate any longer, and the end of this weird alliance was nigh. Luckily, enough griffons were willing to make do with some concessions to not plunge our young state into a civil war. Most, except the most die-hard imperial loyalists, did not seek to restore the Empire, and atrocities of war made ideas of waging another one to create a pangriffonian state rather unpopular.\nOf course, there were many other important issues, like the debate around land reform and privileges of the nobility. If the government is to take the land from nobles, they should be compensated – this notion was not met with much resistance. More radical republicans however suggest completely abolishing noble titles and all vestiges of feudalism. However, the imperialists, wishing to maintain some degree of the old system, proposed noble estates to be integrated into the Federation under its new laws and taxes. Surprisingly enough, this proposal gained enough support to be considered an option, as many regionalists saw this as a step towards greater decentralisation – with influential regional lords becoming a counterbalance to the state, they could haggle for more autonomy for their provinces."

It was a welcome change to seemingly endless nightmares, where he felt only terror, dread and unnatural cold. Now at least he had his body back. He also heard voices, but he couldn’t understand what was happening around him. Even when he managed to open his eyes, everything was... fuzzy. Some griffons in white clothes (nurses?), running around and screaming something. Moments later he again succumbed to the void, however this time his sleep was deep and dreamless.\nNext time he awoke, he felt better – as good as one could in such a state. Covered in so many bandages that he resembled a mummy, feeling pain in numerous wounds on his body, and a deeper, strange one, somewhere in his bones, that felt as if his body was saying to him, “You are not a youngling anymore, you’re in no shape to battle ancient evils.” He’s been in a coma for a week, and a few more days passed before he could stand up again. While doctors from the military hospital did all they could, it seemed as if his wounds were... supernatural in a way, resisting their best efforts as if they were the last vengeance of the fallen God of the North. Nevertheless, Hector was more than pleased to learn that his subordinates managed well without him, sweeping a few final pony holdouts. What was more even more important, unity of the Liberation Army was still strong. Even with him on the verge of death, there were no squabbles, former Imperials and Republicans were still cooperating in stabilising the liberated lands, distributing supplies to former slaves, and beginning a reconstruction effort. A few days later, In spite of doctors’ orders, Hector attended a meeting of the High Command. He spoke little then, debates were being solved peacefully without his intervention. Having faced an overwhelming common enemy, former adversaries sought no more conflict, as if the war had made them more mature, more considerate.\nIt was then he understood that his work was complete. Thanks to his efforts, Herzland would have a future. And all he wanted was to enjoy it in peace. These last years provided him with enough bloodshed, terror, and war for a few lives. Not long after that, during another meeting, Grandmaster Hector Ardennson, Commander of the Herzland Liberation Army announced his plans..."

The common effort to beat northern invaders led to unlikely alliances and at least partially mended the rift between former imperial loyalists and various groups of republicans. Following lengthy negotiations, an agreement was achieved: the Griffonian Empire would be abolished, with the new Kingdom of Herzland taking its place, lead by the former emperor, King Grover. His power would be limited by the new constitution, and the country would abide by republican principles, including establishment of the new Parliament.
