## Events ##
herzland_liberation_goy.01.t:0 "The Fallen One"
 herzland_liberation_goy.01.d:0 "Everfrost stank death and smoke - like every other city after prolonged battle. And the battle for Everfrost was long - pony warriors fought till bitter end - either out of sheer hatred towards griffons, or fearing their ruler's reprisal. Streets were littered with bodies of both living and undead, and many districts have been completely destroyed. However, over this all destruction Snowflake Palace still stood, taunting griffons - not even the artillery fire was able to destroy its walls - whenever a hit, holes were being filled by magical ice, replacing all the damage inflicted to the structure. Frost King might have been cornered in his lair - but attackers could not get to him - every squad of soldiers or knights who entered inside did not return. \nHector Ardensson stood in front of the gate of the palace. For days, first when he slept, now even during daytime he heard a… call. Frost King was speaking to him - taunting him and demanding that the leader of the rebellion fought him in person - not by just sending underlings. And though other commanders tried to dissuade him, Hector knew it was his duty. Old knight went through remnants of the once intricate gates and entered the palace. Inside were also covered in ice - forming all kinds of weird ornaments and sculptures - some of them after closer examination turned out to be frozen bodies. He did not know how long he wandered through the corridors and empty rooms - but after many minutes he found a large hall - and inside it a single creature - a griffon. \nErik Grimclaw seemed to be asleep - leaning on his sword, his head lowered. However, as Hector approached, the younger griffon raised his head. “Hector. Frost King told me, you will come. Again, he was right.” Hector looked on as a fallen knight with utter contempt. “When I was told, you were seen on the frontlines, leading these undead monstrosities… I did not believe it. I thought you have perished in this grim land, and now Tyrant taunts us, like many times he raised others he had slain. But yet you are here. Tell me… Why?” Erik stayed silent for a long moment, his eyes gazing somewhere far away, as if he was somewhere else… “The living ones are weak. We just fight, bicker and betray each other. Do such miserable creatures really deserve freedom? For over thirty years griffons have been killing each other, for petty reasons. They do not deserve freedom, they deserve punishment for their wickedness. You think something will change when you win? These weaklings will just complain and tear apart whatever you build.” Hector drew his sword. “If we were like you believe, I would not be here. Armies of your ‘king’ would not be defeated. We might be weak, but inside every griffon is a spark, a potential for greatness. We will prevail. And we will build a better world.” Erik shrieked and jumped towards Hector, raising his sword. Ardensson was surprised by the speed and strength of Grimclaw - he might be younger, but nevertheless he should not move this quickly - and the old knight was quickly pushed into defense. With every dodge or paired strike, Hector felt, as he was losing his strength. Erik kept attacking and attacking… It would not be long before Arsensson would not have strength to raise his sword… He needed to finish this fight now. His chance was to use Erik rage against him. Hector deliberately feigned slipping - and when Erik tried to strike him down, he managed to get one, decisive stab. Erik stopped abruptly and stared on a blade protruding out of his chest. Fallen knight moved a few steps backwards, and then fell on the floor. Blood pool was quickly growing and it was obvious it was a fatal wound. Hector grabbed Erik’s sword and stood over him. Young knight said nothing, just lowered his head, reconciled with his fate. With one strike, Hector cut Erik’s head off. “I can only hope gods will have mercy upon you, Erik.” He said. There was now only one thing left..."

 herzland_liberation_goy.02.d:0 "Old Hall of Gatherings, now the Frost King throne room… Place resembled a slaughterhouse - dozens of the slayed griffons covered the floor, alongside Frost King undead guards - however most of them were killed by magic, rather than swords. The Tyrant of the North sat on his grandiose ice throne. Even if he tried to be terrifying and regal, it was obvious that holding against artillery barrage and battle of Everfrost took a heavy toll on him - parts of his body were rotting, sometimes even to the bones, as if his magical powers were slowly destroying him.\nIt was almost a pitiful sight - a lone, self proclaimed god, hiding in his palace, even his stolen powers betraying him… But Hector did not pity the creature that killed so many - and wanted to enslave rest. “So, you have finally cometh. I guess, my pawn is dead then? I’m not really surprised, he was more talking than fighting… But yet I at least presumed he will be able to wound you. What a disappointment.” Hector did not answer, just slowly approached the throne, his sword drawn. “No threats? No accusations? No calling the names of your pitiful gods, griffon? You are a knight, you should be all about the honor, talking about great things… I’m not amused.”\n“You deserve nothing, but a quick death, fiend!” Said Hector and charged towards the Frost King. Pony raised his hoof slightly, as if he was bored by this scene. Wave of ice cold air hit Hector, with strength that should knock down a full grown minotaur… And moments later turn him into ice sculpture. Yet he still moved forward. Indifference in the eyes of Frost King was replaced by surprise… and fear. Shards of ice started to rise from the floor, piercing Hector's body - yet he still continued his charge. Visibly desperate, Frost King raised his hoof and a sword shaped icicle appeared in it. Ice hit the steel.. And steel shattered. \nHector fell on the floor, exhausted and weakened by wounds. Frost King stood for a moment silently… And then started to laugh.\n“You fool!” He cackled “You thought you could kill me?! That you could kill a god?!” Frost King stood right over his defeated foe. “I will kill you. But not now. Slowly. So you could witness as I unleash my wrath upon your pitiful comrades and…” At this moment Hector suddenly reached forward… breaking the skin, covering Frost King chest and grasping his ice heart. Before the sorcerer could react, Hector ripped it out of Tyrant's chest… And shattered it, with one hit on the floor. \nFrost King screamed - and fell down - his body rapidly decaying, until nothing but few bones remained. Hector got up from the floor. He could hear trembling - and pieces of ceiling started to fall around - it was time to run. Despite his wounds, he tried to run - to get as far away from the palace as possible. He barely managed to do so - moments after he passed the gate, it collapsed behind him. Hector gave it one last look. There were some griffons, running towards him and screaming… But he did not really hear what they were talking…"

Many of them continued to attack our forces - but the death of their master somehow made them lose all will to fight - many of those we have captured just sit and do not even eat or drink. We did not even expect something like this to happen, and even our battle hardened soldiers pity these creatures. There are also many clansponies that did not have much in common with events of last years - and just lived under the reign of Frost King, never hurting a griffon. We now need to decide the fate of them - while some wanted vengeance - as brutal as possible, Hector Ardensson using all his authority convinced rest of the rebel leadership that instead of repeating the cycle of oppression that led to this moment, what is needed is forgiveness - and that griffons and ponies should learn how to live together, without hatred and war. Still a question remains, what to exactly do with Tir Deighe - some suggest letting clans self-govern, while many believe we should keep garrisons there - just in case ponies decide to release another ancient evil…"

Three archonates held an important position in the Empire, and even now they continue to exert large influence over the newly formed state. However, with the creation of the Kingdom of Herzland, moderate nobility and republicans are unwilling to let the Three Temples return to their former position of power. Question however remains how will it be achieved - some suggest that Archonates should be subdued to the crown and be under its control so we could still benefit from cooperation with Temples, while others believe that secularization of the state and letting Temples operate freely, while being forbidden from exerting influence over politics will be better way to deal with the problem."

With the king's role in daily ruling the state being limited, this office will hold a significant amount of power. While many candidates were proposed, through careful political maneuvering and negotiations between parties and other groups of influence three candidates have gathered enough support to be considered viable ones, able to form a stable government, while also receiving tacit support from Royal Army and influential nobles. First of them is Heinrich Kingfeather, who rose as a major figure in the restored National Republican Party. As a known moderate he would surely appease the republicans in government. Second candidate, Winston Copperhill is however favored by herzlander loyalists and also being supported by many republican leaning griffons, with his candidature being least divisive. The nobility in government pushes for the appointment of Regina Eagleclaw, distant relative of our king as chancellor. While well connected among nobility, she receives least popular support. Question remains, which of the three candidates will be appointed by the parliament and approved by the king."

For now the government has been running on a provisional basis, but time has finally come to solidify our political system, codify various laws that have been voted out by parliament into existence and complete work on the constitution. Of course nothing is as simple as it might seem, and various factions are trying to shape the Kingdom according to their own beliefs and interests. Republicans hope to firmly establish parliament as prime power in the Kingdom, putting more power into the claws of the elected chancellor and subordinate apparatus of the state to him, while limiting the influence of the parliament over the executive branch of the government.. Royalists push for increasing powers of the king and expansion of civil service answering directly to him, while various regionalist movements hope to decentralize the state and give more power to the provinces of the Kingdom."

Hector Ardensson has resigned from the leadership position and retired from politics - while unanimously proclaimed by the new parliament “Father of the Federation”. \nHowever the most important were presidential elections - in few weeks three major candidates emerged - Gabriella di Karthin (who recently distanced herself from the remnants of the National Republican Party), former senator from Romau, promising further democratization of the Federation, Heinrich Kingfeather - an old republican politician from Cloudbury, running on platform of maintaining traditional values and empowering minorities, and Gerben Kogchel - democratic socialist, who managed to rally varied and internally divided communist movements of the Herzland."

While fighting together against Frost King created a unique unity, despite political differences, it is obvious that socialist revolutionaries and old imperial loyalists cannot cooperate any longer, and this weird alliance will come to an end. Luckily, there are enough griffons willing to cooperate and with some concessions we will save our state from collapsing into civil war. Most, except the most die-hard imperial loyalists, did not seek to restore the Empire and atrocities of the war made ideas of waging another one to create a pangriffonian state rather unpopular. There are of course still many issues, like land reform and privileges of nobility - nobles shall be compensated for their land, and there is not much resistance against this idea. More radical republicans however suggest completely abolishing noble titles and all vestiges of feudalism, while imperials wish to maintain some degree of an old system - of course within reason and laws of the new Federation - noble estates would be integrated into the Federation, and comply with its laws. Surprisingly enough they gained the support of many griffons who see this as an opportunity to strive towards greater decentralisation - with more diverse regions being let to maintain a large degree of autonomy."

Common effort to beat northern invaders led to unlikely alliances and led to at least partially mend rift between former imperial loyalists and various groups of republicans. Following lengthy negotiations, an agreement was achieved - Griffonian Empire would be abolished, and its place shall be created a new Kingdom of Herzland, with former emperor Grover as its ruler. His power would be limited by the new constitution, and the country would abide by the republican principles, including establishment of the new parliament. While extremists on both sides have decried this as betrayal of all they fought for, most believe the newly established Kingdom of Herzland to be best chance for peace in region and rapprochement with other nations of Griffonia."
