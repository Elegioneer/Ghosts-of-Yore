### State Description ###
state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_501:0 "Pomazhon"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_501:0 "The §gWarden§! of §7Pomovarra§!"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_501:0 "Before Aquileian conquest, Pomazhon was a minor town of Old Pomovarra with little meaning or important history. After the princedom’s establishment, it became the seat of Aquileian power in the region, precariously surrounded on all sides by its very hostile population. So began the history of Pomazhon as a fortress city, often defending its rulers from uprisings led by their urnuly subjects. The old city’s architecture, including the princely palace itself, reflects this with its walled inner districts – once military barracks – now residences of the few Aquileians unfortunate enough to migrate into the capital of rebellious Pomovarra.\n\nThe city has grown a lot in the recent years, and new districts are now sprawling around dilapidated fortifications, used today as convenient checkpoints by current rulers of the city. There’s only a few cities in Griffonia as scarred as Pomazhon, a battleground of decades-long urban guerilla warfare, where almost every wall is marked with bullet holes, guards are mugging locals in the streets, and youth gangs harass everyone they see as ‘foreign scum’, where at dusk partisans leave their hideouts, and every night the sounds of gunshots interrupt the silence.\n\nAnd yet, if one manages to evade the havoc and walk around the city, traces of Pomovarran history will reveal themselves at every corner: fading paintings of clan symbols and figures from local myths on the walls, little chapels and shrines dedicated to gods and heroes of the past, meticulously maintained by the faithful, who still hold onto their culture and ancient beliefs, despite living in a city meant to erase them."

### Tech and Equipment ###
POM_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Fregneux Fusil 'Modele 80'"
POM_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "FF Modele 80"
POM_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The first mass-produced rifle developed by Fregneux Armories was a revolutionary design for its time, superior to most of the contemporaries, with the company negotiating a mainline small arms contract with the Aquileian Army. Then the Revolution came, and Pomovarra was plunged into chaos. A few years after Reiher’s takeover, blueprints of the rifle were uncovered and put into production to cut the import needs of Prince-colonel's army. By that time being already outdated, today the FF-80 is practically an antique, yet still sturdy and trustworthy."

POM_motorized_equipment_0:0 "Gward Wagons S8"
POM_motorized_equipment_0_desc:0 "By the onset of the second millenium, Gward Wagons' S8 design aged very poorly – mostly because of diesel engines having far outpaced the power output of its coal-powered steam engine. Ironically, this engine was the main reason for its military adoption in Pomovarra. With the rule of the Prince-colonel never being officially recognized by surrounding governments, and the main trade artery blocked by Flowena, Reiher couldn’t procure a steady supply of oil for the military, and thus, had to seek out an alternative."

POM_open_caches:0 "Open the Caches"

POM_fortify_camris:0 "Fortify Cervys"

POM_unify_the_movement_desc:0 "Back when we fought against a common enemy, factions of the resistance were willing to overlook their ideological differences. For Pomovarra’s sake, we should continue on as a united force despite the doctrinal disagreements and personal animosities between movement leaders."
POM_cultural_recovery:0 "Cultural Recovery"

POM_organise_civilian_gov:0 "Organise Civilian Government"
POM_organise_civilian_gov_desc:0 "We cannot run a nation like a warcamp for long – one can clearly see how disastrously it ended for Reiher and his cronies. Time has come to purge the previous administration and establish a proper bureaucracy to govern Pomovarra."
POM_empty_armories:0 "Empty the Armories"
POM_empty_armories_desc:0 "There are still many supply depots and armories left by the Prince-Colonel’s forces, scattered across the land. By interrogating captives and recovering documentation, we can learn locations of these places and use their weapons for a better cause."

POM_cervys_trials:0 "The Cervys Trials"
POM_cervys_trials_desc:0 "While most of the Reiher army leadership had either perished during our glorious revolt or ran away after, we still managed to capture quite a lot of high-ranking officers. Some of them were lynched right away by our soldiers, but there is enough of them left to deliver some actual justice."
POM_gather_volunteer_brigades:0 "Gather Volunteer Brigades"
POM_gather_volunteer_brigades_desc:0 "With the liberation of Pomovarra, many of our brothers and sisters abroad are willing to join our nascent military. We need to organize these brave birds into proper units and prepare them for the coming battles."
POM_fifth_column:0 "The Flowenian Fifth Column"
POM_fifth_column_desc:0 "Thousands of Pomovarrans live in the city of Flowena. Many of them yearn to be reunited with their eastern bretheren. We must reach out to them, and encourage them to assist our army in its rightful conquest."
POM_sideline_the_left:0 "Sideline the Left"
POM_sideline_the_left_desc:0 "While the communist movement in Pomovarra lacks substantial support among the population, now that we are free, the red hydra started to raise its ugly head. It is obvious that socialists are nothing more than bastard spawn of ponies and Aquileians, vile internationalists who reject Pomovarran culture. Time has come for the resistance to publicly denounce them and remind griffons that there is – and never will be – any red on the Pomovarran flag!"
POM_rip_off_the_petals:0 "Rip out the Petals"
POM_rip_off_the_petals_desc:0 "The time has finally come. The City of Gardens – nothing more than a parasite that has sucked on Pomovarran blood for decades – will fall! Our vengeance is near!"

POM_cervys_cannons:0 "Cervys Cannons"
POM_cervys_cannons_desc:0 "Artillery is queen of the battlefield, as many say – and while Reiher's little manoeuvre during the battle of Cervys was ultimately foiled, there is much to learn from it."
POM_military_motorisation:0 "Military Motorisation"
POM_military_motorisation_desc:0 "Speed is becoming an increasingly important factor in warfare, alongside the growing need for supply transportation – an army cannot simply loot everything it needs these days. Motorisation provides solutions for both of these problems. So, let’s get some new trucks!"
POM_formalise_our_doctrine:0 "Formalise Our Doctrine"
POM_formalise_our_doctrine_desc:0 "Until now, every rebel commander fought as they saw fit. And while this approach helped us distract and outmanoeuvre our sedentary enemy, it is completely unsuitable for proper war. We need to analyse the lessons of the revolt and forge a proper doctrine for the Pomovarran Liberation Army."
POM_standardise_infantry_weapons:0 "Standardise Infantry Weapons"
POM_standardise_infantry_weapons_desc:0 "We have been using anything we could put our claws on. As the proverb goes “Beggars can't be choosers”. But now this attitude led us to a logistical nightmare of having to supply and repair dozens of wildly different armament models. We have to establish standards for our army’s equipment and refit some old weapons to suit them. "
POM_learn_from_the_past:0 "Learn from the Past"
POM_learn_from_the_past_desc:0 "There is much to be learned from studying the past. Old magic, ways to unleash powers now believed to be forgotten. Our researchers should delve deeper into old tomes of knowledge and try to uncover the magical secrets of past ages."
POM_establish_the_mic:0 "Military-Industrial Complex' Foundation"
POM_establish_the_mic_desc:0 "Some griffons tend to complain about ties between private business and the military. Not us! In order to bolster our military supplies, we will support companies willing to produce them. What bad can come out of it anyway?"
POM_children_pomovarra_native:0 "Children of Pomovarra"
POM_children_pomovarra_native_desc:0 "We learned a lot from hundreds of years of fighting foreign invaders. We learned how to adapt, how to use terrain for our advantage, and how to make as much as possible from what little we had. Now, we need to codify this knowledge."
POM_reform_officer_corps:0 "Reform the Officer Corps"
POM_reform_officer_corps_desc:0 "Time has come to reorganize the ranks of the Liberation Army. Performance of rebel commanders will be reviewed; they will be given proper ranks, and those exhibiting lack of proper training will be sent to newly organised officer courses. "
POM_retrain_our_forces:0 "Retain our Forces"
POM_retrain_our_forces_desc:0 "Pomovarrans are few, and our enemies are many. More resources should be directed towards ensuring that as many as possible of our soldiers survive the battles and remain able to fight another day."
POM_outrun_our_enemies:0 "Outrun Our Enemies"
POM_outrun_our_enemies_desc:0 "Some creatures across the world seem to have developed the unhealthy need for speed. While we are not these maniacs, we have to admit that the vision of a rapidly moving steel avalanche of tanks is... weirdly alluring."
POM_resist_any_damage:0 "Tank Any Damage"
POM_resist_any_damage_desc:0 "There is this weird concept, that when a hulking, steel behemoth appears on the battlefield, enemies have to concentrate all weapons they have on it. The solution? Add more armour and laugh as they fail to destroy our tanks."
POM_fregneux_military_academy:0 "Fregneux Military Academy"
POM_fregneux_military_academy_desc:0 "Officer courses are not enough! As our old comrades in arms are aging and starting to think of retirement, there comes a need for a new generation of officers. With the foundation of Fregneux Military Academy we will be able to pass the knowledge of old freedom fighters to the new generation of career commanders."
POM_mandatory_military_service:0 "Mandatory Service"
POM_mandatory_military_service_desc:0 "If we want to fight our enemies on equal terms, every able-bodied Pomovarran must be ready to become a soldier. Through massive propaganda campaigns and mandatory military training we will strive to increase the numbers of potential recruits for our army."
POM_expand_elite_formations:0 "Expand Elite Formations"
POM_expand_elite_formations_desc:0 "Our numbers are few, and the only reasonable way to fight our enemies is to ensure that our soldiers are the best of the best."
POM_expand_production:0 "Armouoberenn Expansion"
POM_expand_production_desc:0 "We need more! More guns, more cannons, more tanks, more shells! An age of war is coming, and what we need is as many weapons as we can get. Time has come to optimise our military production, reach out to our industrious friends in the private sector, and ensure we get all the tools of war that we need!"
POM_rather_death_than_dishonour:0 "Rather Death than Dishonour"
POM_rather_death_than_dishonour_desc:0 "Spirit of defiance, spirit of freedom – these are what makes a Pomovarran. Every one of our soldiers must be ready to fight for their homeland – and we must encourage this mindset by glorifying the virtue of fighting for our country. The proverb of ancient Pomovarrans will guide our military!"
POM_champions_of_pomovarra:0 "Champions of Pomovarra"
POM_champions_of_pomovarra_desc:0 "In the past we were led by great kings, chieftains, and warlords, ones who did not fear to fight gods themselves, ones who could inspire nations and fight entire armies by themselves. While there are no such great griffons anymore, we can emulate their example – by putting only the best and the bravest in charge of our military. Officers who don’t only lead, but also inspire."
POM_direndall_project:0 "Direndall Project"
POM_direndall_project_desc:0 "The famous sword forged by the Dogs of the east for king Madoc, Direndall, was made to pierce any armour. A fitting name for a programme to create a new line of magitek weapons for our army – now every Pomovarran soldier will carry a weapon worthy of ancient kings!"

POM_rebuild_our_economy:0 "Rebuild our Economy"
POM_rebuild_our_economy_desc:0 "If Pomovarra is to become a strong nation, it must be a prosperous nation. After decades of mismanagement, devastation, and outright looting, our economy is in shambles, and we need to begin the arduous process of rebuilding it."
POM_country_roads:0 "Country Roads"
POM_country_roads_desc:0 "Wherever you go, they will take you home!"
POM_eagleton_route:0 "Eagleton Route"
POM_eagleton_route_desc:0 "Flowena and Aquileia do their best to strangle our trade with tariffs and restrictions. The solution for it would be establishment of a railroad towards Adelart’s city of Eagleton. With it, we will get easy access to Skyfall port. Of course, there is the issue of Adelartian government's permission to create such a railroad..."
POM_infrastructure_investments:0 "Invest in Infrastructure"
POM_infrastructure_investments_desc:0 "Benefits of proper infrastructure are countless: the ability to rapidly transport large quantities of material and personnel are invaluable both for industry and the military. Our efforts must be directed to the expansion of railroads and highways across Pomovarra."
POM_window_into_the_world:0 "Window Into the World"
POM_window_into_the_world_desc:0 "Being landlocked has for a long time limited our foreign trade capabilities. Now, when we have established our control over Aquileian port cities, we can finally reach out to the world. The city of Skyaluzzo is the perfect location for our main port, but its infrastructure needs expansion to suit our needs."
POM_riches_of_the_land:0 "Riches of the Land"
POM_riches_of_the_land_desc:0 "There are many natural resources to be found in Pomovarra – most of them left unexploited. Now however, time has come to dig deep and greedily and put all these riches to use for the benefit of our nation."
POM_exploit_cam_deposits:0 "Exploit Cam Deposits"
POM_exploit_cam_deposits_desc:0 "A recent survey revealed large quantities of rare metals in our northern territories. By exploiting them, we can decrease our dependence on import of these crucial materials."
POM_refurbish_steelworks:0 "Refurbish Old Steelworks"
POM_refurbish_steelworks_desc:0 "Mines and steel mills of Pomovarra have been a core industry of the region for decades. However, in recent years many of them have fallen into disrepair. By restoring these abandoned industrial plants, we will provide our economy with much needed resources."
POM_rubber_substitutes:0 "Rubber Substitutes"
POM_rubber_substitutes_desc:0 "Rubber is becoming an increasingly important resource for military industry. Sadly, our lands are not fit for rubber tree plantations. However, chemistry offers a different solution: production of synthetic rubber. Although expensive, it will mitigate our lack of natural sources of this material."
POM_black_gold:0 "Black Gold in the North"
POM_black_gold_desc:0 "Adelartian oil fields are among the most bountiful in Griffonia. Luckily for us, they are so vast that, in fact, a part of them lies under our territories, as proved by our prospectors. While we cannot match the output of our northern neighbour, exploiting this deposit will secure our supply of crude oil."
POM_synthetic_crystals:0 "Invest in Synthetic Crystals"
POM_synthetic_crystals_desc:0 "Another material our lands lack are crystals – crucial in production of modern electronics, magitek equipment, and – according to some – weapons of mass destruction. However, in recent years several researchers suggested that it would be possible to create synthetic crystals on an industrial scale."
POM_dig_even_deeper:0 "Dig Even Deeper"
POM_dig_even_deeper_desc:0 "Lands of outer Pomovarra are filled with various resources we could exploit for the benefit of our nation. Different regions offer different opportunities, so let’s grab shovels and pickaxes and start digging!"
POM_strive_for_autarky:0 "Strive For Autarky"
POM_strive_for_autarky_desc:0 "A nation that cannot secure its supply of raw materials for industry is a weak nation, dependent on the whims of its neighbours. With recent expansion of our mining industry, we can move towards an autarkic model of economy, one which will ensure safety and prosperity of our nation."
POM_village_schools:0 "Teacher in Every Village"
POM_village_schools_desc:0 "Griffons from rural areas have always retained a strong Pomovarran identity – which led Aquileians to brand them as “backward savages” and shift focus to developing cities. Countryside griffons might be proud and brave, but there is a reason why many call them uneducated hicks. Time has come to change it!"
POM_adult_literacy:0 "Adult Literacy Programme"
POM_adult_literacy_desc:0 "While we have ensured that future generations will be properly educated, we cannot forget about older griffons. For a modern nation it is crucial that every adult can read and write properly. Otherwise, education is impossible!"
POM_engineering_courses:0 "Engineering Courses"
POM_engineering_courses_desc:0 "Anyone who’s seen pitiful attempts of our farmers to deal with machines such as tractors, understands that most of our population lacks even basic technical knowledge. By organising courses, we should be able to train a new generation of mechanics able to work with modern technology."
POM_technical_research_institute:0 "Technical Research Institute"
POM_technical_research_institute_desc:0 "A proper institution meant to study, replicate, and further develop newest technological achievements. Some called it shameless copying of others' work, but we do not listen to these envious, petty griffons! They are obviously just jealous."
POM_university_of_pomazhon:0 "University of Pomazhon"
POM_university_of_pomazhon_desc:0 "Until now, Pomovarra lacked a proper higher education centre, forcing bright griffons to leave our nation if they wanted to continue their studies. To deal with this problem, the University of Pomazhon will be founded. With focus on history and culture, it will surely become a beacon of not only knowledge, but also our cultural recovery."
POM_economy_reforged:0 "Economy Reforged"
POM_economy_reforged_desc:0 "It took us much time and effort, but now we are among the developed nations of Griffonia. Our nation is prosperous, our industry is continuously expanding, and the future finally looks bright for us."
POM_towards_the_future:0 "Into the Future"
POM_towards_the_future_desc:0 "The technological race cannot be truly won – it is a continuous effort to not stay behind rivals. Laboratories, research institutes, engineering schools – we need them, and we are finally able to afford them."
POM_due_industrialisation:0 "Due Industrialisation"
POM_due_industrialisation_desc:0 "For centuries we have been a distant province of Aquileia, lacking proper investments to fund industrial development. As a result, while our neighbours have long ago embraced the industrial revolution, we are lagging behind. Time has come to change this."
POM_cervys_industrial_zone:0 "Cervys Industrial Zone"
POM_cervys_industrial_zone_desc:0 "While, by no means, is Southern Pomovarra a developed region, the northern province of Cam is even more of a backwater. With establishment of an industrial zone in the city of Cervys and preferential treatment of capitalists willing to invest into it, we can reinvigorate the region and provide its griffons with well-paid jobs."
POM_modernise_fregneux_armory:0 "Modernise Fregneux Armory"
POM_modernise_fregneux_armory_desc:0 "Military industry located in the city of Fregneux provides us with the majority of weapons used by our army. However, its factories are in dire need of modernisation to meet modern standards of gun production quality."
POM_expand_heavy_industry:0 "Expand Heavy Industry"
POM_expand_heavy_industry_desc:0 "Now that our industrial base has been properly established, we can proceed with expansion of our manufacturing capabilities. By supporting several new ventures into heavy industry, we can hugely increase our productive potential."
POM_integrate_flowenian_industry:0 "Integrate Flowenian Industry"
POM_integrate_flowenian_industry_desc:0 "Flowena is one of the richest cities in Griffonia. While it is primarily known for its banks, its industrial capacity cannot be underestimated. With our reclamation of the city, we can make full use of that potential."
POM_steady_ahead:0 "Steady Ahead"
POM_steady_ahead_desc:0 "Our industrialisation plan proved to be a huge success. Our economy is booming, and we are on a good way to become an industrial powerhouse of Western Griffonia, leaving behind our past of backwardness and economic desolation."
POM_arcturius_plan:0 "Arcturius Plan"
POM_arcturius_plan_desc:0 "Named after the god of war and craftsmanship, the Arcturius Plan will focus on developing both our core regions and outer territories of Pomovarra. This massive undertaking will allow us to further expand our industrial capabilities."
POM_utilise_flowenian_expertise:0 "Utilise Flowenian Expertise"
POM_utilise_flowenian_expertise_desc:0 "There are many well-educated engineers in Flowena. With some incentive, they would be willing to share their technical expertise with us. Thanks to it, we should be able to bypass certain limitations put on us by our lack of technological base."
POM_clear_the_land:0 "Clear the Land"
POM_clear_the_land_desc:0 "Large swathes of Pomovarra are neglected wasteland, useless for our economy. We will focus our efforts on reclamation of these areas in order to turn them into bountiful farmlands."
POM_modernise_agriculture:0 "Modernise Agriculture"
POM_modernise_agriculture_desc:0 "While a large part of our population makes a living through farming, they don’t produce as much as they could due to outdated agricultural practices and lack of machinery. Well, there’s no time to lose. Let’s distribute tractors and get to work! "
POM_welfare_programs:0 "Create Welfare Programmes"
POM_welfare_programs_desc:0 "Solidarity has always been an important part of Pomovarran culture. Only by helping each other we managed to make it through difficult times. However, not every problem can be solved by the local community, and it is where government intervention is needed."
POM_expand_urban_centres:0 "Expand Urban Centres"
POM_expand_urban_centres_desc:0 "Until now, Pomovarra has been mostly a rural region, with its cities paling in comparison to the metropolises of Aquileia or Herzland. With steady growth of our economy more and more griffons migrate into cities, which creates a necessity for organised expansion – unless we wish to end up with slums like Griffonstone has! "

POM_expand_pomazhon_airfield:0 "Expand Pomazhon's Airfield"
POM_expand_pomazhon_airfield_desc:0 "Situated in the city’s outskirts, the small airfield of Pomazhon did not have any strategic meaning until now – but with some funds allocated, we can expand it into a proper military air base."
POM_bring_the_bombers:0 "Bring the Bombers"
POM_bring_the_bombers_desc:0 "If you have a problem with a dug-in enemy army, bring in the bombers and drop things from the skies: bombs, napalm... whatever you see fit!"
POM_train_new_pilots:0 "Train New Pilots"
POM_train_new_pilots_desc:0 "Without properly trained pilots, our air force will not be able to operate at high efficiency. So, hire instructors, set up flight courses, allocate fuel – and go!"
POM_finance_new_fighters:0 "Finance New Fighters"
POM_finance_new_fighters_desc:0 "Fighter planes are a core element of any air force. By providing air superiority, they make safe use of more specialized types of planes possible. Obviously, we should invest in creating new designs of fighter planes."
POM_even_bigger_bombers:0 "Even Bigger Bombers"
POM_even_bigger_bombers_desc:0 "There is an irritating habit of enemies hiding their crucial infrastructure deep behind their lines – far beyond the reach of our bombers. To solve this problem a great new invention appeared: ‘strategic bombers’."
POM_aces_in_the_skies:0 "Aces in the Skies"
POM_aces_in_the_skies_desc:0 "We do not need any pilots; we need the best pilots we can get, true knights of the skies. Hopefully, with a more rigorous training regimen, we will be able to achieve this goal."
POM_expand_air_defences:0 "Expand Air Defences"
POM_expand_air_defences_desc:0 "We are not the only ones expanding the air force, and our enemies will surely try to strike our infrastructure. To prevent this, we must expand the Pomovarran air defence network."
POM_continue_aircraft_development:0 "Continue Aircraft Development"
POM_continue_aircraft_development_desc:0 "We need to provide our scientists with more funds if we want to develop truly modern aircraft."
POM_wrath_of_boreas:0 "Wrath of Boreas"
POM_wrath_of_boreas_desc:0 "There are rumours about ongoing projects to create the ultimate weapon: a bomb able to destroy entire cities. The so-called atomic bomb, merging the power of science and magic into a tool of destruction greater than anything achieved before. We must be the first to obtain such a weapon."
POM_radar_research:0 "Radar Research"

POM_roaring_rockets_desc:0 "Until recently, rockets were a curiosity, with very limited usage in warfare. Now however, with refinement of jet engine technology, they have become a viable weapon; one we need to have."
POM_lightning_fast:0 "Nippy Fighters"

POM_death_from_above_desc:0 "We love the smell of napalm in the morning – and we’d love to see the entire enemy nation smell like this. So, let’s develop larger bombs, and let’s get more of them!"

POM_call_of_the_ocean:0 "Call of the Ocean"
POM_call_of_the_ocean_desc:0 "Pomovarrans were never griffons of the seas, as we have always preferred our ancestral hills and forests over the vast emptiness of the ocean. Yet now time has come for us to exert our control over the seas."
POM_review_foreign_doctrines:0 "Review Foreign Doctrines"
POM_review_foreign_doctrines_desc:0 "It is obvious we know close to nothing about organising and commanding a navy. Instead of learning from our own mistakes, we should learn from the ages of mistakes made by others – by copying foreign naval doctrines."
POM_ramp_up_production:0 "Ramp Up Production"
POM_ramp_up_production_desc:0 "To match the numbers of ships of our enemies we need to start a large-scale programme of naval expansion. It will be costly of course, but it is necessary if we want to have more than a few makeshift boats. "

POM_commission_carriers:0 "Commission Carriers"
POM_commission_carriers_desc:0 "With aviation changing the nature of land warfare, sooner or later it will doubtlessly change naval warfare as well. It’s best we stay on the cutting edge and build carriers to fully utilise the destructive potential of airplanes at sea."
POM_sea_boars:0 "Sea Boars"
POM_sea_boars_desc:0 "Our methodical and relentless approach pays back even in the field, in which we had no previous experience. Through sheer persistence we have built up our naval capabilities from nothing. Perhaps, in time we will be able to proudly claim that Pomovarra rules the waves!"

POM_our_glorious_past:0 "Our Glorious Past"
POM_our_glorious_past_desc:0 "The Old Kingdom of Pomovarra was destroyed by Aquileian barbarians over seven centuries ago. Yet we did not forget the glory of this age – and while kings might be gone, the venerable realm of our ancestors still lives in the heart of every Pomovarran"

POM_reestablish_the_clan_system_desc:0 "Foreign occupiers did all they could to shatter the clan system of Pomovarra, however many griffons kept honouring their great ancestors, founders of the clans, and cultivating ties with their fellow clangriffs. By restructuring our administration around old clan borders, assigning clanless griffs to existing clans and – if needed – recreating extinct ones, we will reinforce the feeling of brotherhood and traditional values of our society."
POM_purify_the_language:0 "Purify the Language"
POM_purify_the_language_desc:0 "Throughout the years of foreign rule, the Pomovarran language became polluted with Herzlandish and Aquileian words. Some even claim that what we speak today isn’t Pomovarran anymore, but merely a dialect of Aquileian! As language is the foundation of every nation, time has come to start the linguistic reform and also to make Pomovarran the only official language of our country."
POM_slander_the_PPP:0 "Slander the PPP"
POM_slander_the_PPP_desc:0 "The so-called ‘Patriotic Party of Pomovarra’ continues to be a thorn in our side. Composed of lackeys of the deceased Harman Camriz, they do not accept the new destiny of our people and rally the locals against us. It would be foolish to resort to violence against our own, instead we will use all means possible to picture them as traitors of our cause, Aquileian agents. In time, the PPP threat will be gone – and then we’ll just leave them to perish, forgotten and alone."
POM_reclaim_adelart:0 "Reclaim Adelart"

POM_boars_of_arcturius_desc:0 "Facing many enemies in ancient times, Pomovarrans were in need of protectors. And so a few groups of warriors stood up to the task, dedicating their lives to Pomovarra and god Arcturius.

POM_raise_the_bulwark:0 "Raise the Bulwark"
POM_raise_the_bulwark_desc:0 "The numbers are against us, and to succeed in war with Aquileia, we must have a very good plan.

POM_live_by_the_sword:0 "Live by the Sword"
POM_live_by_the_sword_desc:0 "Life of a Pomovarran was always one of struggle and war. The struggle of a dying nation clinging to life, the constant war against foreign invaders.

Our legacy will be eternal!"

POM_slay_the_great_maar_desc:0 "Time has come for a final showdown, a clash of destinies. The Great Maar of Griffonia, Aquileia, is resurgent and ready to strike us. If they win, there will be no future for Pomovarra. It is our duty to the past and future generations to prevail."
POM_liberate_verenia:0 "Liberate Verenia"
POM_liberate_verenia_desc:0 "In the east lies ‘Verenia’, a name bestowed by conquerors who subjugated Pomovarran and Rumarean clans that inhabited these lands centuries before.

POM_land_of_equines_desc:0 "Equines proved to be very easily tainted by Aquileian rot. There’s no telling how many generations it will take to reshape the twisted spirits of these poor creatures.

POM_destroy_aquileian_legacy:0 "Destroy Aquileian Legacy"
POM_destroy_aquileian_legacy_desc:0 "A nation lives as long as the creatures that remember it.

POM_born_to_rule:0 "Born to Rule"
POM_born_to_rule_desc:0 "Hierarchy is the natural state of societies: there are ones who rule, and ones who are being ruled. As we need new elites to rule the Reborn Kingdom, we will choose the most loyal and distinguished of us to become the new nobility of Pomovarra."

POM_a_city_for_the_king_desc:0 "Every realm’s capital is a reflection of its power and prosperity. While Pomazhon is a city of rich Pomovarran history, it is nevertheless a backwater of Griffonia, commanding very little respect. The Reborn Kingdom deserves a more fitting seat of power."
POM_eternal_epic:0 "Eternal Epic"
POM_eternal_epic_desc:0 "A good story can change the way one thinks, can shape nations and ways griffons view the past. We will not leave our story to be turned into myth by outsiders.

POM_pomovarrisation:0 "Pomovarrisation"
POM_pomovarrisation_desc:0 "If we want the Reborn Kingdom to last, we need to conquer not only the lands of our enemies, but also their souls and minds.

POM_dwell_on_the_past_desc:0 "When Aquileians destroyed the Old Kingdom, they stole many of it legendary treasures, tried to erase our tradition and eradicated the magical arts of ancient Pomovarra.

POM_reaching_the_sky:0 "Reaching For the Sky"
POM_reaching_the_sky_desc:0 "City of Skyfall is for Herzland what Flowena was for us – a despicable parasite. We will do all griffons a favor by getting rid of its greedy oligarchs and using the city’s riches for the greater good."

POM_establish_tarrin_march:0 "Establish the Tarrin March"
POM_establish_tarrin_march_desc:0 "In the ancient era, lands known today as Tarrin were the southernmost area inhabited by Pomovarrans.

POM_rip_out_the_heart:0 "Rip Out the Heart"
POM_rip_out_the_heart_desc:0 "Truly, Pomovarra must become a new centerpiece of griffon civilization! For this, the so-called “Imperial Heartlands” must be subjugated. Only then will we match the achievements of past great conquerors – and be able to guide Griffonkind into a new era."

POM_the_hermit_kingdom_desc:0 "If we want to achieve the dream of a restored, purified Pomovarra we need to deal with lingering foreign influence.

POM_end_the_imperial_line:0 "End the Imperial Bloodline"
POM_end_the_imperial_line_desc:0 "While the Empire is dead, its last ruler remains.

POM_griffonian_dominions:0 "Griffonian Dominions"
POM_griffonian_dominions_desc:0 "As we continue our conquests across Griffonia, it is becoming obvious that we cannot rule the continent alone: there are just too many griffons and too few Pomovarrans. There are however more than enough cowards and opportunists we can use as convenient puppets. "
POM_old_forest_reservation:0 "Old Forest Reserve"
POM_old_forest_reservation_desc:0 "Forest of Scheisswald, despite Herzlanders’ attempts to ‘civilize’ it, remains a reminder of a bygone age of magic and untamed wilderness in Griffonia. We must cleanse it from its true taint – the griffons who dared to settle it!"

POM_resettlement_programme:0 "Resettlement Programme"
POM_resettlement_programme_desc:0 "Forcing large numbers of Aquileians and Herzlanders into newly conquered territories will yield two benefits: lessen the number of undesirables in the central regions of the High Kingdom and create tensions in outlying provinces, making the locals fight newcomers instead of us."

POM_of_ponies_and_war:0 "Of Ponies and War"
POM_of_ponies_and_war_desc:0 "One of Aquileian advantages is their superiority in the field of military applications of magic – achieved mostly thanks to their pony subjects. For Pomovarra to be able to stand a chance against Aquileia, we need to develop our own magical weapons."

POM_rein_in_clans_desc:0 "With our newly gained freedom, old clan feuds are once again becoming a threat to our stability.

Back in those days, the region was a melting pot of different tribes, many of them leaving it to settle in other parts of Griffonia, which led to Sparelans naming it the “Land of the Origin” – the place from which a seemingly endless stream of nations and peoples emerged. Now, we will embrace this name to reflect our multinationalism."

POM_old_faith_old_country_desc:0 "Archonates are nothing more than a tool of the Empire and Aquileia to control the conquered nations of Griffonia. Even now, many traditionalistic Pomovarrans refuse to acknowledge the authority of archons.

POM_scavenge_flowena_airport_desc:0 "There are a number of airplanes we could use on a local airfield. Also, we should ‘encourage’ whatever pilots and mechanics remained there to join our army. It’s not like there’s anyone but us who will pay them, so that’s a win for them anyway!"

POM_hostile_takeover:0 "Hostile Takeover"
POM_hostile_takeover_desc:0 "De Bleuetaille kept his promise: he turned the city upside down, both metaphorically and quite literally. Every hidden treasury was sacked, every security and stock we obtained got turned into shining golden idols. True riches of Flowena are ours."

POM_steal_the_fire:0 "Steal the Fire of the Gods"
POM_steal_the_fire_desc:0 "The beauty of an atomic bomb exploding is the ultimate power of science, wielded by griffon claws, and proof that modern-day mortals can finally match so-called divinities. When we master the atomic fire, we shall become truly unstoppable."
POM_new_ecole_militaire:0 "New Ecole Militaire"
POM_new_ecole_militaire_desc:0 "We need a proper institution to prepare new generations of officers, free of reactionary taint and ready to serve the Revolution to the bitter end on future fronts of the war of liberation."

POM_captain_takes_the_helm:0 "Captain Takes the Helm"
POM_captain_takes_the_helm_desc:0 "Chaos provides unique opportunities. With political rivals out of the picture, Victor Allard is free to pursue his political goal, unshackled by the need to make compromises with moderates who only slow down the communist revolution."
POM_galvanise_the_pop:0 "Galvanize the Population"
POM_galvanise_the_pop_desc:0 "Griffons must know who is responsible for the current situation taking hold: liberals, traitors, and reactionaries! They all must know how to deal with them: with weapons, claws, and determination!"
POM_defeat_warlords:0 "Defeat the Warlords"
POM_defeat_warlords_desc:0 "With central command gone, Reiher’s mercenary army has disintegrated into dozens of bandit groups. While they’re easy to deal with one after another, they have spread all across the country in search of loot. They must be dealt with, if we want to reestablish order."
POM_convene_the_committee:0 "Convene the Committee"
POM_convene_the_committee_desc:0 "Now, as order slowly returns to Aquileia, cowards and traitors raise their heads and demand ‘representation’ in the Committee for Public Safety. And so, like a farmer plucking weeds, we must rid our governing body of these unwanted elements, lest we want the disaster of the preceding months to happen again."
POM_reactionary_trials:0 "Trials of the Reactionaries"
POM_reactionary_trials_desc:0 "‘Scapegoats’ is such an ugly word... Better name them ‘targets of the justified anger of the people’. There is no doubt they are all guilty – only remaining questions are of what exactly and how to punish them."
POM_revolutionary_zeal:0 "Revolutionary Zeal"
POM_revolutionary_zeal_desc:0 "The task ahead of us is a great: to reforge our society and liberate Griffonia – and then the rest of the world. To achieve this, the entirety of Aquileia must be united under a single goal: the fight for the triumph of the Revolution on every front. For that, all media shall be controlled by the state and be made to broadcast our message."
POM_terror_as_order:0 "Terror as Order of the Day"
POM_terror_as_order_desc:0 "Our society is permeated by rogue elements – from the top to its very bottom. Nobles, reactionaries, capitalists, and traitors – all must be dealt with. We cannot falter in our dedication to hunt and eliminate them. Otherwise, they will plot against the Commune and sabotage our Revolution!"
POM_centralise_authority:0 "Centralise Authority"
POM_centralise_authority_desc:0 "Every successful organisation is hierarchical. The alternative is a mob, and a mob is led by its lowest instincts – and will fail to achieve any goal or grow as a society. Therefore, all local autonomies will be removed, with the Party relegated to an advisory role to the Committee and its Leader, who will exert his will through his ministers."
POM_glory_of_war:0 "Glory of War"
POM_glory_of_war_desc:0 "It is the duty of every citizen of the Commune to fight and die for it – and the greatest honour is to be a soldier. As the triumph of the Revolution is inevitable, the only question is when it will happen – and it is up to the Commune’s griffons to make sure this day comes soon."
POM_master_destiny:0 "Master our Destiny"
POM_master_destiny_desc:0 "Mortals will be the only ones who can determine their future and rule the world. If we want to achieve true liberation, there can be no authority above the state. Therefore, citizens cannot bow to any gods – or griffons who claims to be their servants!"
POM_control_the_past:0 "Control the Past"
POM_control_the_past_desc:0 "Each of us is a composition of our past experiences, shaped by those who surround us, and in the greater picture, by our society, nation, and history. If we want to create a truly new state, we need new creatures to inhabit it. To create them, we need to destroy memories of the past, so they can’t not be tainted by them."
POM_enemies_within:0 "Traitors Within"
POM_enemies_within_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, there are still griffons who oppose the inevitable triumph of the Revolution. They hide among us, waiting for an opportunity to strike, cleverly disguising themselves as loyal citizens and tainting the disgruntled locals from newly conquered territories with thoughts of treason. "
POM_enemies_without:0 "Enemies Without"
POM_enemies_without_desc:0 "Our enemies are numerous, and we must use every tool to defeat them. Through subversion and espionage, we shall weaken foreign reactionary regimes and make them easy targets for our liberationary armies."
POM_cult_of_the_revolution:0 "Cult of the Revolution"
POM_cult_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "The Revolution is a historical inevitability, culmination of thousands of years of philosophical, societal, and political development, the ushering of a new age. It is only natural to enshrine the virtues of the Revolution as the pillars of our reforged society."
POM_le_patron:0 "Le Patron"
POM_le_patron_desc:0 "No other griffon exemplifies the virtues of the Revolution more than our leader, Victor Allard. He is more than just a politician, he is a visionary who reshapes reality, destroys the past, and constructs the future. He is Le Patron, Leader of the Revolution, Leader of Commune, the one who will guide us to victory!"
POM_liberators_of_the_world:0 "Liberators of the World"
POM_liberators_of_the_world_desc:0 "The Revolution cannot be contained to one country. Its final goal is to liberate the entire world. We will fight on every continent and destroy every reactionary regime, until the world becomes united under our glorious Commune."
POM_liberate_herzland:0 "Liberate Herzland"
POM_liberate_herzland_desc:0 "Imperialists fight for the rotting corpse of their homeland, believing they can once again put their yoke on Griffonia. If we do not act quickly, they will consolidate their forces and attack. We must do so first and catch them off-guard!"
POM_topple_oligarchs:0 "Topple Oligarchs of Skyfall"
POM_topple_oligarchs_desc:0 "The so-called ‘Free Cities of Griffonia’ under Skyfall are nothing more than a glorified labour camp, with oligarchs for overseers and workers for prisoners. It is our duty to liberate our ailing comrades in these cities."
POM_red_rumare:0 "Red Rumare"

POM_destroy_imperial_vestiges:0 "Destroy Imperial Vestiges"
POM_destroy_imperial_vestiges_desc:0 "If we want to establish a full control over Herzland we must ensure every remnant of the former imperial regime is torn down - by doing so we will show once and for all that the age of the Empire is gone - and the age of the Commune has begun."
POM_strike_karthinia:0 "Strike Karthinia"
POM_strike_karthinia_desc:0 "The Griffonian South is a land of old, decadent civilizations that have survived too long past their prime. One kick – and these regimes will crumble like the marble temples of their ancestors. Like so, we will bring liberation to our southern brothers and sisters."
POM_light_the_pyre:0 "Light the Pyre"
POM_light_the_pyre_desc:0 "This might be the single greatest victory of our Revolution. A truly symbolic moment which will forever live in history and finally sever the figurative umbilical cord that ties griffons to their past. We will once and for all ensure griffons as a race leave their cradle!"
POM_into_evi_valley:0 "Into Evi Valley"
POM_into_evi_valley_desc:0 "Liberation of the continent is progressing swiftly. Our next target is the Evi Valley. Disunited reactionary regimes of the region will surely be unable to pose any actual threat to the glorious army of the Commune."
POM_northern_liberation:0 "Northern Liberation"

POM_humble_the_south_desc:0 "Following our victory over southern warlords, time has come to properly integrate the region into the Commune. Of course, we can expect a certain degree of resistance from stubborn southrons, but it’s nothing we’ve not dealt with before."
POM_pacify_the_valley:0 "Pacify the Valley"
POM_pacify_the_valley_desc:0 "Backward griffons of Evi Valley are strongly divided across cultural and religious lines, making the entire region a complete mess. Nevertheless, we will attempt to civilise them, and shape them into proper communists! "
POM_red_sun_rises:0 "Red Sun Rises"
POM_red_sun_rises_desc:0 "There must be something magical about the Griffonian East, where feudal overlords, false republicans, and slavers coexist in complete harmony, content in cooperating to hold the locals in shackles and ignorance. We will march through the Riverlands until we reach the ocean!"
POM_establish_northern_workcamps:0 "Establish Northern Labour Camps"
POM_establish_northern_workcamps_desc:0 "The northern mountains have many positive traits. They are distant, remote, have a harsh climate and are rich in resources. Due to all this, they are the perfect place for a subset of redemption camps for particularly problematic reactionaries."
POM_intercontinental_campaigns:0 "Intercontinental Campaigns"
POM_intercontinental_campaigns_desc:0 "Now our work truly starts. While we have already liberated the majority of Griffonia, time has come to prepare for invasion of other continents. Of course, such a plan would require a sufficient amount of preparation... But surely the decadent, reactionary regimes of Equus and Zebrica will be no match for our battle-hardened armies!"
POM_death_of_allard:0 "Death of Allard"
POM_death_of_allard_desc:0 "Having been in power for just a few years, Aquileian dictator, Victor Allard, suddenly dies. Now the members of the Committee for Public Safety scramble for power."
POM_commemorate_our_leader:0 "Commemorate our Leader"
POM_commemorate_our_leader_desc:0 "Our glorious leader perished tragically, but even in death he can serve the Commune. He is a powerful symbol – and we will make it so every creature in the Commune knows his ideals and stands by them... well, by the version we will make them know."
POM_purge_allardists:0 "Purge Allardists"
POM_purge_allardists_desc:0 "While most of bureaucrats and military personnel will simply fall in line, there is a number of powerful griffons... too dedicated to Allard’s vision for their own good. We will quietly dispose of them and supress everyone else who try to question our decisions."
POM_reassess_sentences:0 "Reassess Sentences"
POM_reassess_sentences_desc:0 "Redemption Camps are a useful tool, yet they were overfilled with convicts, often sentenced for ridiculous reasons. Of course, we will not release any actual reactionaries or enemies of the state, but to lessen the strain on our penitentiary system and to create the impression of ‘reconciliation’, we can release some creatures sentenced for lesser infractions (those who are still alive anyway)."
POM_retreat_from_the_riverlands:0 "Retreat from the Riverlands"
POM_retreat_from_the_riverlands_desc:0 "The Riverlands campaign was a costly mistake. Riverponies turned out to know their guerrilla warfare better than even Pomovarrans! Every day we lose dozens of troops trying to police this mess. We will give control over the territories to local communist groups and let them handle this disaster."
POM_revolution_on_one_continent:0 "Revolution on One Continent"
POM_revolution_on_one_continent_desc:0 "One day, the Revolution will engulf the entire world. For now, we are content with our victory in Griffonia and should focus on reinforcing our control over the continent. Plans of intercontinental wars will be shelved for an indeterminate future. Though we’ll keep villainising some distant enemies to keep our population vigilant and fervent!"
POM_end_cultural_policies:0 "End Cultural Policies"
POM_end_cultural_policies_desc:0 "While certain groups within the Commune are inherently reactionary, indiscriminate prosecution of all kinds of religious and nationalist groups drastically diminished our capabilities to control the continent. We will end most of these policies, especially ones targeting the most revolutionary aware group of all: Aquileians."
POM_share_the_spoils:0 "Share the Spoils"
POM_share_the_spoils_desc:0 "The Army has proven extremely useful in the recent ‘transition of power’, but now they demand a voice in the government. And so do party functionaries, unhappy with lack of any control over the Committee – which to be fair has had some positions vacated recently... Ensuring that all major interest groups of the Commune are represented in the Committee will let us avoid political infighting."

POM_flowenian_chokepoint_desc:0 "Us being situated in the Peripherie, flanked by Verenia and surrounded by lesser unfriendly polities – offspring of bloody civil wars – our only viable trade route lies through the city of Flowena.

POM_pomovarran_uprising:0 "Pomovarran Uprising"
POM_pomovarran_uprising_desc:0 "The locals passionately hate us and take every casual opportunity to sabotage our rule. The more ideological Pomovarrans wage guerilla warfare, making our existence here one of constant struggle. We cannot hope for any support from them, and whoever we recruit quickly proves to be a rebel mole. We have to rely on the few foreigners living here and mercenaries to man our army. Rebels grow bolder with every day, and soon they will strike."
POM_warlord_government:0 "Warlord Government"
POM_warlord_government_desc:0 "Despite our grandiose claim to power, we are little more than an army stranded in a distant land. Our rule over Pomovarra is one of military occupation, and our ‘bureaucracy’ is nearly non-existent, with military commanders wielding absolute power over the regions assigned to them. Obviously, this does not work very well."

POM_linguistic_reform_desc:0 "The only official language of our state is Reformed Pomovarran, cleansed of foreign influences. All other languages are forbidden to be used in administration, education, or by the media.

goy_pomovarra.323.t:0 "A Rogue Retiree"
goy_pomovarra.323.d:0 "Our little tropical paradise gained quite a reputation as a refuge for all kinds of expats seeking cozy retirement – to our great benefit, of course! These retirees brought with them all their – surely lawfully and ethically obtained – wealth and spent it lavishly in our casinos, bars, and other establishments meant to cater to the needs of wealthy tourists. From our local colourful collection of deposed presidents, officers of defeated armies, and banished nobles, one individual stands out.\nWhen a lone warship approached our shores, first observers thought it a brazen pirate vessel, intent on looting our islands. Soon however, it was identified as Imperatrice Giselde, an Aquileian battleship. After the Revolution, any lingering presence of our former metropoly disappeared, yet some wondered if Aquileia decided to restore their reign in this distant corner of the world. After the battleship anchored near our capital port, instead of a marine squad, a lone envoy – a diamond dog – emerged, bringing a message from his commander, Leopold Reiher. Once a Reichsarmee officer, then warlord of Pomovarra. Somehow, he managed to conquer Aquileia, and after this, didn’t even bother trying to rule it, instead loading everything of value on the captured battleship and heading for Les Meridiennes. The renegade’s offer was simple: he shares some of his astounding wealth with us in return for local citizenship and protection from anyone who would demand his return to Griffonia (not that we have extradition laws anyway). As the unspoken alternative was finding out if the crew remembered to take some artillery shells alongside all the gold, we graciously accepted the offer.\nEver since, Reiher has been a local celebrity here, with him and his merry crew of former militarygriffs, mercenaries, and other similar creatures busy recklessly spending their marvelous wealth – even with their extravagance, it would probably take several lifetimes to empty their coffers, that is, if their livers did not give up first. However, now the unthinkable happened: we ended up in a nigh-unwinnable war. As soon as news about the conflict spread across the capital, the colonel himself, still stinking like a rum distillery, requested a meeting and asked us to grant him supreme command of the defences of Les Meridiennes, which he admittedly grew very fond of. If agree, he will use his substantial wealth, connections among mercenary companies and the black market, along with his personal retinue of veteran soldiers, including the warship he arrived with – bigger than anything we have – for the war effort. As his ‘credentials’ he simply pointed out that he conquered a quarter of Griffonia starting with less. Of course, it is up to us if we want to take this offer: as Reiher bluntly put it, he’s not used to work for anyone else but himself. And if we do not want his help, he will set sail towards some even more distant destination, preferably with nice weather and a similarly lax extradition policy."

goy_pomovarra.325.t:0 "A Literal Beach Episode of War"
goy_pomovarra.325.d:0 "When the army of so-called Prince-Colonel Reiher marched through Western Griffonia, behind it left a trail of destruction and looted cities. In a way, worse even than the Storm King in Zebrica, Reiher proved utterly incapable and uninterested in any form of governing conquered lands, treating them only as a way to gather more resources for his final strike – one which shattered the ailing Aquileia, bringing an end to the rotting ancien régime.\nWhile it provided us with an opportunity to reforge our society in the fires of the Revolution, it also left a sour aftertaste of destruction Reiher has inflicted upon us. Luckily, the Colonel – in a style typical of ancient raiders – just took everything he deemed valuable, loaded it on the biggest warship he could find, left abandoned by its unpaid crew, and sailed towards the horizon.\n\nIt took some time before news of his further actions reached us. Apparently, he’d taken refuge in a place where all similar individuals go: Les Meridiennes, a former colony of the Aquileian crown, left essentially abandoned after the Second Revolution and ruled by ramshackle local government, built on the remains of the royal governorate. Harboring various unsavory individuals was an important source of income for this pathetic statelet, perfect conditions for Reiher to set up shop – or rather a battleship – there, drinking and gambling away his stolen fortune. However, justice might be delayed, but never avoided, and soon Les Meridiennes found themselves at war.\nWhile many of the ‘retirees’ hanging out there decided to leave for more peaceful places, it seems that Prince-Colonel apparently took control of the local government and started building up defences. Entire Aquileia is united in hopes and dreams of Reiher finally meeting his demise – be it in our or someone else’s claws. No matter how this barbarian meets his fate, every Aquileian will be relieved."
