POM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC1:0 "Defeated, but not broken, griffons of Pomovarra suffered a lot under the Aquileian yoke, yet never forgot their proud legacy. However, their last attempt to regain freedom during the revolution that engulfed the entire continent was foiled by Leopold Reiher, a warlord who now calls himself 'Prince-colonel'. Despite his oppression, Pomovarrans are ready to rise again – maybe for the last time – to fight for their freedom... But what will freedom even mean for those who know nothing but war?"

### State Description ###
state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_501:0 "Pomazhon"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_501:0 "The §gWarden§! of §7Pomovarra§!"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_501:0 "Before Aquileian conquest, Pomazhon was a minor town of Old Pomovarra with little meaning or important history. After the princedom’s establishment, it became the seat of Aquileian power in the region, precariously surrounded on all sides by its very hostile population. So began the history of Pomazhon as a fortress city, often defending its rulers from uprisings led by their urnuly subjects. The old city’s architecture, including the princely palace itself, reflects this with its walled inner districts – once military barracks – now residences of the few Aquileians unfortunate enough to migrate into the capital of rebellious Pomovarra.\n\nThe city has grown a lot in the recent years, and new districts are now sprawling around dilapidated fortifications, used today as convenient checkpoints by current rulers of the city. There’s only a few cities in Griffonia as scarred as Pomazhon, a battleground of decades-long urban guerilla warfare, where almost every wall is marked with bullet holes, guards are mugging locals in the streets, and youth gangs harass everyone they see as ‘foreign scum’, where at dusk partisans leave their hideouts, and every night the sounds of gunshots interrupt the silence.\n\nAnd yet, if one manages to evade the havoc and walk around the city, traces of Pomovarran history will reveal themselves at every corner: fading paintings of clan symbols and figures from local myths on the walls, little chapels and shrines dedicated to gods and heroes of the past, meticulously maintained by the faithful, who still hold onto their culture and ancient beliefs, despite living in a city meant to erase them."

POM_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The first mass-produced rifle developed by Fregneux Armories was a revolutionary design for its time, superior to most of the contemporaries, with the company negotiating a mainline small arms contract with the Aquileian Army. Then the Revolution came, and Pomovarra was plunged into chaos. A few years after Reiher’s takeover, blueprints of the rifle were uncovered and put into production to cut the import needs of Prince-colonel's army. By that time being already outdated, today the FF-80 is practically an antique, yet still sturdy and trustworthy."

POM_motorized_equipment_0_desc:0 "By the onset of the second millenium, Gward Wagons' S8 design aged very poorly – mostly because of diesel engines having far outpaced the power output of its coal-powered steam engine. Ironically, this engine was the main reason for its military adoption in Pomovarra. With the rule of the Prince-colonel never being officially recognized by surrounding governments, and the main trade artery blocked by Flowena, Reiher couldn’t procure a steady supply of oil for the military, and thus, had to seek out an alternative."

POM_sideline_the_left_desc:0 "While the communist movement in Pomovarra lacks substantial support among the population, now that we are free, the red hydra started to raise its ugly head.

POM_formalise_our_doctrine:0 "Formalise Our Doctrine"
POM_formalise_our_doctrine_desc:0 "Until now, every rebel commander fought as they saw fit.

We need to analyse the lessons of the revolt and forge a proper doctrine for the Pomovarran Liberation Army."
POM_standardise_infantry_weapons:0 "Standardise Infantry Weapons"
POM_standardise_infantry_weapons_desc:0 "We have been using anything we could put our claws on. As the proverb goes “Beggars can't be choosers”.

POM_children_pomovarra_native_desc:0 "We learned a lot from hundreds of years of fighting foreign invaders. We learned how to adapt, how to use terrain for our advantage, and how to make as much as possible from what little we had. Now, we need to codify this knowledge."
POM_reform_officer_corps:0 "Reform the Officer Corps"

POM_outrun_our_enemies:0 "Outrun Our Enemies"
POM_outrun_our_enemies_desc:0 "Some creatures across the world seem to have developed the unhealthy need for speed. While we are not these maniacs, we have to admit that the vision of a rapidly moving steel avalanche of tanks is... weirdly alluring."
POM_resist_any_damage:0 "Tank Any Damage"
POM_resist_any_damage_desc:0 "There is this weird concept, that when a hulking, steel behemoth appears on the battlefield, enemies have to concentrate all weapons they have on it. The solution? Add more armour and laugh as they fail to destroy our tanks."
POM_fregneux_military_academy:0 "Fregneux Military Academy"
POM_fregneux_military_academy_desc:0 "Officer courses are not enough! As our old comrades in arms are aging and starting to think of retirement, there comes a need for a new generation of officers.

POM_mandatory_military_service:0 "Mandatory Service"
POM_mandatory_military_service_desc:0 "If we want to fight our enemies on equal terms, every able-bodied Pomovarran must be ready to become a soldier. Through massive propaganda campaigns and mandatory military training we will strive to increase the numbers of potential recruits for our army."

POM_rather_death_than_dishonour:0 "Rather Death than Dishonour"
POM_rather_death_than_dishonour_desc:0 "Spirit of defiance, spirit of freedom – these are what makes a Pomovarran.

The proverb of ancient Pomovarrans will guide our military!"
POM_champions_of_pomovarra:0 "Champions of Pomovarra"
POM_champions_of_pomovarra_desc:0 "In the past we were led by great kings, chieftains, and warlords, ones who did not fear to fight gods themselves, ones who could inspire nations and fight entire armies by themselves. While there are no such great griffons anymore, we can emulate their example – by putting only the best and the bravest in charge of our military. Officers who don’t only lead, but also inspire."
POM_direndall_project:0 "Direndall Project"
POM_direndall_project_desc:0 "The famous sword forged by the Dogs of the east for king Madoc, Direndall, was made to pierce any armour. A fitting name for a programme to create a new line of magitek weapons for our army – now every Pomovarran soldier will carry a weapon worthy of ancient kings!"

POM_rebuild_our_economy:0 "Rebuild our Economy"

POM_eagleton_route_desc:0 "Flowena and Aquileia do their best to strangle our trade with tariffs and restrictions. The solution for it would be establishment of a railroad towards Adelart’s city of Eagleton. With it, we will get easy access to Skyfall port. Of course, there is the issue of Adelartian government's permission to create such a railroad..."
POM_infrastructure_investments:0 "Invest in Infrastructure"
POM_infrastructure_investments_desc:0 "Benefits of proper infrastructure are countless: the ability to rapidly transport large quantities of material and personnel are invaluable both for industry and the military.

POM_window_into_the_world:0 "Window Into the World"
POM_window_into_the_world_desc:0 "Being landlocked has for a long time limited our foreign trade capabilities. Now, when we have established our control over Aquileian port cities, we can finally reach out to the world.

POM_refurbish_steelworks_desc:0 "Mines and steel mills of Pomovarra have been a core industry of the region for decades. However, in recent years many of them have fallen into disrepair. By restoring these abandoned industrial plants, we will provide our economy with much needed resources."
POM_rubber_substitutes:0 "Rubber Substitutes"
POM_rubber_substitutes_desc:0 "Rubber is becoming an increasingly important resource for military industry. Sadly, our lands are not fit for rubber tree plantations. However, chemistry offers a different solution: production of synthetic rubber. Although expensive, it will mitigate our lack of natural sources of this material."
POM_black_gold:0 "Black Gold in the North"
POM_black_gold_desc:0 "Adelartian oil fields are among the most bountiful in Griffonia. Luckily for us, they are so vast that, in fact, a part of them lies under our territories, as proved by our prospectors. While we cannot match the output of our northern neighbour, exploiting this deposit will secure our supply of crude oil."
POM_synthetic_crystals:0 "Invest in Synthetic Crystals"
POM_synthetic_crystals_desc:0 "Another material our lands lack are crystals – crucial in production of modern electronics, magitek equipment, and – according to some – weapons of mass destruction. However, in recent years several researchers suggested that it would be possible to create synthetic crystals on an industrial scale."
POM_dig_even_deeper:0 "Dig Even Deeper"
POM_dig_even_deeper_desc:0 "Lands of outer Pomovarra are filled with various resources we could exploit for the benefit of our nation. Different regions offer different opportunities, so let’s grab shovels and pickaxes and start digging!"
POM_strive_for_autarky:0 "Strive For Autarky"
POM_strive_for_autarky_desc:0 "A nation that cannot secure its supply of raw materials for industry is a weak nation, dependent on the whims of its neighbours. With recent expansion of our mining industry, we can move towards an autarkic model of economy, one which will ensure safety and prosperity of our nation."
POM_village_schools:0 "Teacher in Every Village"
POM_village_schools_desc:0 "Griffons from rural areas have always retained a strong Pomovarran identity – which led Aquileians to brand them as “backward savages” and shift focus to developing cities. Countryside griffons might be proud and brave, but there is a reason why many call them uneducated hicks. Time has come to change it!"
POM_adult_literacy:0 "Adult Literacy Programme"
POM_adult_literacy_desc:0 "While we have ensured that future generations will be properly educated, we cannot forget about older griffons. For a modern nation it is crucial that every adult can read and write properly. Otherwise, education is impossible!"
POM_engineering_courses:0 "Engineering Courses"
POM_engineering_courses_desc:0 "Anyone who’s seen pitiful attempts of our farmers to deal with machines such as tractors, understands that most of our population lacks even basic technical knowledge. By organising courses, we should be able to train a new generation of mechanics able to work with modern technology."
POM_technical_research_institute:0 "Technical Research Institute"
POM_technical_research_institute_desc:0 "A proper institution meant to study, replicate, and further develop newest technological achievements. Some called it shameless copying of others' work, but we do not listen to these envious, petty griffons! They are obviously just jealous."
POM_university_of_pomazhon:0 "University of Pomazhon"
POM_university_of_pomazhon_desc:0 "Until now, Pomovarra lacked a proper higher education centre, forcing bright griffons to leave our nation if they wanted to continue their studies. To deal with this problem, the University of Pomazhon will be founded. With focus on history and culture, it will surely become a beacon of not only knowledge, but also our cultural recovery."
POM_economy_reforged:0 "Economy Reforged"

POM_due_industrialisation:0 "Due Industrialisation"
POM_due_industrialisation_desc:0 "For centuries we have been a distant province of Aquileia, lacking proper investments to fund industrial development. As a result, while our neighbours have long ago embraced the industrial revolution, we are lagging behind. Time has come to change this."
POM_cervys_industrial_zone:0 "Cervys Industrial Zone"
POM_cervys_industrial_zone_desc:0 "While, by no means, is Southern Pomovarra a developed region, the northern province of Cam is even more of a backwater. With establishment of an industrial zone in the city of Cervys and preferential treatment of capitalists willing to invest into it, we can reinvigorate the region and provide its griffons with well-paid jobs."
POM_modernise_fregneux_armory:0 "Modernise Fregneux Armory"

POM_integrate_flowenian_industry_desc:0 "Flowena is one of the richest cities in Griffonia. While it is primarily known for its banks, its industrial capacity cannot be underestimated. With our reclamation of the city, we can make full use of that potential."
POM_steady_ahead:0 "Steady Ahead"
POM_steady_ahead_desc:0 "Our industrialisation plan proved to be a huge success. Our economy is booming, and we are on a good way to become an industrial powerhouse of Western Griffonia, leaving behind our past of backwardness and economic desolation."
POM_arcturius_plan:0 "Arcturius Plan"
POM_arcturius_plan_desc:0 "Named after the god of war and craftsmanship, the Arcturius Plan will focus on developing both our core regions and outer territories of Pomovarra. This massive undertaking will allow us to further expand our industrial capabilities."
POM_utilise_flowenian_expertise:0 "Utilise Flowenian Expertise"
POM_utilise_flowenian_expertise_desc:0 "There are many well-educated engineers in Flowena. With some incentive, they would be willing to share their technical expertise with us. Thanks to it, we should be able to bypass certain limitations put on us by our lack of technological base."
POM_clear_the_land:0 "Clear the Land"

POM_modernise_agriculture:0 "Modernise Agriculture"
POM_modernise_agriculture_desc:0 "While a large part of our population makes a living through farming, they don’t produce as much as they could due to outdated agricultural practices and lack of machinery. Well, there’s no time to lose. Let’s distribute tractors and get to work! "
POM_welfare_programs:0 "Create Welfare Programmes"
POM_welfare_programs_desc:0 "Solidarity has always been an important part of Pomovarran culture. Only by helping each other we managed to make it through difficult times. However, not every problem can be solved by the local community, and it is where government intervention is needed."
POM_expand_urban_centres:0 "Expand Urban Centres"
POM_expand_urban_centres_desc:0 "Until now, Pomovarra has been mostly a rural region, with its cities paling in comparison to the metropolises of Aquileia or Herzland. With steady growth of our economy more and more griffons migrate into cities, which creates a necessity for organised expansion – unless we wish to end up with slums like Griffonstone has! "

POM_expand_pomazhon_airfield:0 "Expand Pomazhon's Airfield"
POM_expand_pomazhon_airfield_desc:0 "Situated in the city’s outskirts, the small airfield of Pomazhon did not have any strategic meaning until now – but with some funds allocated, we can expand it into a proper military air base."

POM_even_bigger_bombers_desc:0 "There is an irritating habit of enemies hiding their crucial infrastructure deep behind their lines – far beyond the reach of our bombers. To solve this problem a great new invention appeared: ‘strategic bombers’."
POM_aces_in_the_skies:0 "Aces in the Skies"
POM_aces_in_the_skies_desc:0 "We do not need any pilots; we need the best pilots we can get, true knights of the skies. Hopefully, with a more rigorous training regimen, we will be able to achieve this goal."
POM_expand_air_defences:0 "Expand Air Defences"
POM_expand_air_defences_desc:0 "We are not the only ones expanding the air force, and our enemies will surely try to strike our infrastructure. To prevent this, we must expand the Pomovarran air defence network."

POM_wrath_of_boreas_desc:0 "There are rumours about ongoing projects to create the ultimate weapon: a bomb able to destroy entire cities.

POM_radar_research:0 "Radar Research"

POM_roaring_rockets:0 "Roaring Rockets"
POM_roaring_rockets_desc:0 "Until recently, rockets were a curiosity, with very limited usage in warfare. Now however, with refinement of jet engine technology, they have become a viable weapon; one we need to have."
POM_lightning_fast:0 "Nippy Fighters"

POM_death_from_above_desc:0 "We love the smell of napalm in the morning – and we’d love to see the entire enemy nation smell like this. So, let’s develop larger bombs, and let’s get more of them!"

POM_call_of_the_ocean:0 "Call of the Ocean"
POM_call_of_the_ocean_desc:0 "Pomovarrans were never griffons of the seas, as we have always preferred our ancestral hills and forests over the vast emptiness of the ocean. Yet now time has come for us to exert our control over the seas."
POM_review_foreign_doctrines:0 "Review Foreign Doctrines"
POM_review_foreign_doctrines_desc:0 "It is obvious we know close to nothing about organising and commanding a navy. Instead of learning from our own mistakes, we should learn from the ages of mistakes made by others – by copying foreign naval doctrines."
POM_ramp_up_production:0 "Ramp Up Production"
POM_ramp_up_production_desc:0 "To match the numbers of ships of our enemies we need to start a large-scale programme of naval expansion. It will be costly of course, but it is necessary if we want to have more than a few makeshift boats. "

POM_commission_carriers:0 "Commission Carriers"
POM_commission_carriers_desc:0 "With aviation changing the nature of land warfare, sooner or later it will doubtlessly change naval warfare as well. It’s best we stay on the cutting edge and build carriers to fully utilise the destructive potential of airplanes at sea."
POM_sea_boars:0 "Sea Boars"
POM_sea_boars_desc:0 "Our methodical and relentless approach pays back even in the field, in which we had no previous experience. Through sheer persistence we have built up our naval capabilities from nothing. Perhaps, in time we will be able to proudly claim that Pomovarra rules the waves!"

POM_our_glorious_past:0 "Our Glorious Past"
POM_our_glorious_past_desc:0 "The Old Kingdom of Pomovarra was destroyed by Aquileian barbarians over seven centuries ago. Yet we did not forget the glory of this age – and while kings might be gone, the venerable realm of our ancestors still lives in the heart of every Pomovarran"

POM_reestablish_the_clan_system_desc:0 "Foreign occupiers did all they could to shatter the clan system of Pomovarra, however many griffons kept honouring their great ancestors, founders of the clans, and cultivating ties with their fellow clangriffs. By restructuring our administration around old clan borders, assigning clanless griffs to existing clans and – if needed – recreating extinct ones, we will reinforce the feeling of brotherhood and traditional values of our society."
POM_purify_the_language:0 "Purify the Language"
POM_purify_the_language_desc:0 "Throughout the years of foreign rule, the Pomovarran language became polluted with Herzlandish and Aquileian words. Some even claim that what we speak today isn’t Pomovarran anymore, but merely a dialect of Aquileian! As language is the foundation of every nation, time has come to start the linguistic reform and also to make Pomovarran the only official language of our country."
POM_slander_the_PPP:0 "Slander the PPP"
POM_slander_the_PPP_desc:0 "The so-called ‘Patriotic Party of Pomovarra’ continues to be a thorn in our side. Composed of lackeys of the deceased Harman Camriz, they do not accept the new destiny of our people and rally the locals against us. It would be foolish to resort to violence against our own, instead we will use all means possible to picture them as traitors of our cause, Aquileian agents. In time, the PPP threat will be gone – and then we’ll just leave them to perish, forgotten and alone."
POM_reclaim_adelart:0 "Reclaim Adelart"

POM_boars_of_arcturius_desc:0 "Facing many enemies in ancient times, Pomovarrans were in need of protectors. And so a few groups of warriors stood up to the task, dedicating their lives to Pomovarra and god Arcturius. Today we find ourselves once again in need of such griffons, and for this purpose we shall create a knightly order made up of the best warriors in the land."
POM_raise_the_bulwark:0 "Raise the Bulwark"
POM_raise_the_bulwark_desc:0 "The numbers are against us, and to succeed in war with Aquileia, we must have a very good plan.

POM_reintegrate_old_pomovarra_desc:0 "We managed to successfully reclaim the heart of the Old Pomovarran Kingdom.

POM_live_by_the_sword:0 "Live by the Sword"
POM_live_by_the_sword_desc:0 "Life of a Pomovarran was always one of struggle and war. The struggle of a dying nation clinging to life, the constant war against foreign invaders. And so, we shall embrace our destiny as eternal warriors. Every effort of our society must be dedicated to the great conflicts which await us. We will fear neither war, nor death. Our legacy will be eternal!"
POM_slay_the_great_maar:0 "Slay the Great Maar"
POM_slay_the_great_maar_desc:0 "Time has come for a final showdown, a clash of destinies. The Great Maar of Griffonia, Aquileia, is resurgent and ready to strike us. If they win, there will be no future for Pomovarra. It is our duty to the past and future generations to prevail."
POM_liberate_verenia:0 "Liberate Verenia"
POM_liberate_verenia_desc:0 "In the east lies ‘Verenia’, a name bestowed by conquerors who subjugated Pomovarran and Rumarean clans that inhabited these lands centuries before.

POM_give_all_we_can_desc:0 "There are decades when nothing happens – and weeks when ages pass. In moments like these, griffons must forsake their own ambitions and needs, and give all they can to the nation. And griffons of Pomovarra are ready to do so."

POM_land_of_equines:0 "Land of Equines"
POM_land_of_equines_desc:0 "Equines proved to be very easily tainted by Aquileian rot. There’s no telling how many generations it will take to reshape the twisted spirits of these poor creatures. To ensure they do not cause problems in the meantime we will move them west into a special protectorate, where they will, under our guidance, forge their own path for the equines of Griffonia."
POM_destroy_aquileian_legacy:0 "Destroy Aquileian Legacy"
POM_destroy_aquileian_legacy_desc:0 "A nation lives as long as the creatures that remember it. If we want to once and for all get rid of Aquileia we must destroy every monument to it, every work of its culture, and in one way or another ensure that former Aquileian elites are no longer able to taint our Reborn Kingdom."
POM_born_to_rule:0 "Born to Rule"
POM_born_to_rule_desc:0 "Hierarchy is the natural state of societies: there are ones who rule, and ones who are being ruled. As we need new elites to rule the Reborn Kingdom, we will choose the most loyal and distinguished of us to become the new nobility of Pomovarra."
POM_a_city_for_the_king:0 "The Royal City"
POM_a_city_for_the_king_desc:0 "Every realm’s capital is a reflection of its power and prosperity. While Pomazhon is a city of rich Pomovarran history, it is nevertheless a backwater of Griffonia, commanding very little respect. The Reborn Kingdom deserves a more fitting seat of power."
POM_eternal_epic:0 "Eternal Epic"
POM_eternal_epic_desc:0 "A good story can change the way one thinks, can shape nations and ways griffons view the past. We will not leave our story to be turned into myth by outsiders.

POM_pomovarrisation:0 "Pomovarrisation"
POM_pomovarrisation_desc:0 "If we want the Reborn Kingdom to last, we need to conquer not only the lands of our enemies, but also their souls and minds.

POM_dwell_on_the_past:0 "Explore the Past"
POM_dwell_on_the_past_desc:0 "When Aquileians destroyed the Old Kingdom, they stole many of it legendary treasures, tried to erase our tradition and eradicated the magical arts of ancient Pomovarra. However, they could not make use of what they had stolen, treating it as mere trophies. Now that we’ve reclaimed these artifacts, we can relearn much of our past."
POM_reaching_the_sky:0 "Reaching For the Sky"
POM_reaching_the_sky_desc:0 "City of Skyfall is for Herzland what Flowena was for us – a despicable parasite. We will do all griffons a favor by getting rid of its greedy oligarchs and using the city’s riches for the greater good."
POM_eastern_kin:0 "Eastern Kin"
POM_eastern_kin_desc:0 "East of us lie the lands of Rumare – another ancient griffon civilisation, truly akin to us – oppressed and deprived of their ancestral lands. With all that remains of the once proud nation being a group of small islands, and their culture dying, Rumareans are in dire need of our help – and the need to be reunited with the Reborn Kingdom."
POM_establish_tarrin_march:0 "Establish the Tarrin March"
POM_establish_tarrin_march_desc:0 "In the ancient era, lands known today as Tarrin were the southernmost area inhabited by Pomovarrans. Through centuries, Sparleans, Karthinians, and Aquileians all waged wars over the control of this region as a “gateway” between Western and Southern Griffonia. Now it has become critical for the security of our own heartlands."
POM_rip_out_the_heart:0 "Rip Out the Heart"
POM_rip_out_the_heart_desc:0 "Truly, Pomovarra must become a new centerpiece of griffon civilization! For this, the so-called “Imperial Heartlands” must be subjugated. Only then will we match the achievements of past great conquerors – and be able to guide Griffonkind into a new era."
POM_the_hermit_kingdom:0 "Hermit Kingdom"
POM_the_hermit_kingdom_desc:0 "If we want to achieve the dream of a restored, purified Pomovarra we need to deal with lingering foreign influence.

POM_the_claw_of_the_gods_desc:0 "For a long time, the will of the gods has been interpreted and twisted by archons.who used it to attain political power. With our conquest of Herzland we shall get rid of them.

POM_end_the_imperial_line:0 "End the Imperial Bloodline"
POM_end_the_imperial_line_desc:0 "While the Empire is dead, its last ruler remains. While some might think of him as a powerless child, he is nevertheless a powerful symbol of an order we have just vanquished.

POM_griffonian_dominions:0 "Griffonian Dominions"
POM_griffonian_dominions_desc:0 "As we continue our conquests across Griffonia, it is becoming obvious that we cannot rule the continent alone: there are just too many griffons and too few Pomovarrans. There are however more than enough cowards and opportunists we can use as convenient puppets. "
POM_old_forest_reservation:0 "Old Forest Reserve"
POM_old_forest_reservation_desc:0 "Forest of Scheisswald, despite Herzlanders’ attempts to ‘civilize’ it, remains a reminder of a bygone age of magic and untamed wilderness in Griffonia. We must cleanse it from its true taint – the griffons who dared to settle it!"
POM_tame_the_great_river:0 "Tame the Great River"

POM_eclipse_the_south_desc:0 "The venerable Southern Griffonia, land of the oldest realms of Griffonia, today is merely a pale shadow of its former glory, with the great empires of Sparleos and Karthinia lost to time. Thus, we must come to bring the end to the decrepit states of the southrons."

POM_resettlement_programme:0 "Resettlement Programme"
POM_resettlement_programme_desc:0 "Forcing large numbers of Aquileians and Herzlanders into newly conquered territories will yield two benefits: lessen the number of undesirables in the central regions of the High Kingdom and create tensions in outlying provinces, making the locals fight newcomers instead of us."

POM_our_flowenian_foes_desc:0 "Ever since its foundation, the city of Flowena has been strangling Pomovarra, getting richer while Pomovarrans toiled under Aquileian oppression. For all their riches however, Flowenians proved unable to resist our army."
POM_of_ponies_and_war:0 "Of Ponies and War"
POM_of_ponies_and_war_desc:0 "One of Aquileian advantages is their superiority in the field of military applications of magic – achieved mostly thanks to their pony subjects. For Pomovarra to be able to stand a chance against Aquileia, we need to develop our own magical weapons."
POM_rein_in_clans:0 "Dealing with the Clans"
POM_rein_in_clans_desc:0 "With our newly gained freedom, old clan feuds are once again becoming a threat to our stability.

POM_dream_of_a_united_aetia_desc:0 "Aetia – the ancient name of Western Griffonia, dating to times before the reign of Arantigos. Back then, the region was a melting pot of tribes, many leaving it to settle in other parts of Griffonia, which led to Sparelans naming it the “Land of Origin” – the place from which a seemingly endless stream of nations and peoples emerged. To reflect our multinationalism, we will embrace this name."

POM_aetian_foreign_legion:0 "Aetian Foreign Legion"
POM_aetian_foreign_legion_desc:0 "The principle of liberty is the most important of all: from it comes the idea of republicanism itself.

POM_all_griffons_can_dream_desc:0 "It has been an age of wars, hatred, and suffering for all Griffonkind. But from it, a new, better future was born.

POM_honour_the_deal_desc:0 "Conflict with Herzlanders is inevetable – but through clever use of old divide and conquer strategy we can ensure our swift victory. Luckily, there are griffons in Feathisia who would be more than receptive to our offers of dividing Herzland between our two nations."
POM_guided_democracy:0 "Guided Democracy"
POM_guided_democracy_desc:0 "With victory over Aquileia, we can move away from emergency measures needed to manage our state during war. The Grand Council will be reformed to serve as the higher house of the newly formed parliament, with respected griffons nominated as advisors for our government."

Once ‘Prince-Colonel’ Leopold Reiher conquered Aquila, he simply... disappeared, along with several ships of the Aquileian navy, his officers, and wealth he had amassed during the campaign. Without any leadership, infighting began within his army of mercenaries and bandits, making them unable to contain yet another Aquileian revolution, a communist uprising led by the infamous radical, Victor Allard. While fighting continues in the ravaged land, Allard has already proclaimed the formation of the ‘Aquileian Commune’ – and his plans to bring a new, communist order to the entirety of Griffonia.

goy_pomovarra.2.d:0 "It has become a tradition that a week after the New Year’s celebration, Prince-Colonel would invite his trusted commanders for a party in his headquarters in the city of Pomazhon. Finest Wingbardian wines, food made by the best cook he could hire in Pomovarra (and trust he would not poison it), and an unlucky group of musicians who ended up in his ‘sojourn’ many years ago. A welcome moment of respite in these dangerous days. Seasoned veterans joked and drank, with each toast becoming less coherent. However, Reiher himself was weirdly frugal in drinking today. He fiddled with the glass in his claws, watching the ruby liquid flowing around the walls. He felt weirdly nostalgic. Twenty-seven years. He was exactly that old, being one of the youngest colonels in Reichsarmee’s history, when he deserted and wrestled control over Pomovarra. He was double that now. He had spent exactly half of his life here, and for what? Stuck between the anvil and the hammer of the Empire and Aquileia, fighting these pesky rebels, squeezing whatever little riches remained in this land. Would he die like this? Was there nothing more in life for him?\nSuddenly, a loud blast made the room shake. Lights flickered, the most drunk of the officers fell off their chairs. The rest flocked to the windows. Outside, in the distance, they could see the glow of fire. No doubt, it was yet another attack by the rebels – too close for comfort this time.\nWith a look of determination on his face, Reiher stood up and hit the table with a clenched fist, gaining the attention of every officer in the room.\n“Gentlegriffs. I think we have had enough for today. This is getting old, every time we beat these rebels, they appear again out of nowhere. We have been too cautious, grown too complacent. It is time to deal with the problem once and for all, and go for a greater bounty than this pitiful piece of land. We will...” he hesitated for a moment before another flash of inspiration hit him, “We will march across La Peripherie, and then we will take Aquila! We will be known as the most daring – and when we sack the city – the richest griffs on the entire continent. Are you with me?”"

Colonel Reiher knew the value of intelligence in military operations. Now, he was going through reports from his agents. From many little pieces of information, a broad picture quickly revealed itself.\nThe Second Revolution was near. \nAquileia was on the verge of civil war, and it seemed that even the army and royal intelligence were compromised. How the events would unfold and who would win remained unknown for now, but one thing was certain. Within months, an all-out war would break out. And before, there would be a time of complete chaos with royal purges and Republican assassinations spurring civil strife. More importantly, in this time Aquileia would not be able to launch an assault against his forces. Then he could use the opportunity to further weaken Aquileia with his agents... if he managed to deal with his own problems quickly enough."

All the drinking probably doesn’t help either,” the diamond dog smiled, “Good to see you’re still alive, Leopold. The situation here seems... unstable.”\n“You tell me,” the colonel sighed, “It is like a burning madhouse – with us inside. So, how was your journey? Oh, and have a seat, I have some nice wine here...” Reiher looked for another glass, found it, filled it. The dog emptied it in a single gulp and frowned,\n“You should order to whip the seller. Is this supposed to be Wingbardian wine?” he checked the label, “I clearly taste cheap Verenian... watered down too. But let’s get to business. Like you ordered, I have been to Skyfall and Herzland. Rumours are, the Emperor will kick the bucket soon, and everyone is getting ready for it. There will be bloodshed, and with it, foreign weapons and mercenaries will flood the region. It will be easier than ever to buy stuff, though it won’t be cheap. Demand will be high. However, I have secured preferential treatment from some of my old contacts. After all, we’ve always paid on time, and are considered solid customers. Just get me enough cash, and I will get what’s needed.”\n“Good work, as always,” Reiher smiled faintly, and after a brief moment pointed to the bottle,"

goy_pomovarra.5.d:0 "Outside of main cities, control of the garrison was limited to strategic roads and the few industrial installations considered vital. Other than that, soldiers usually tried their best to avoid getting into ‘dangerous’ areas without direct orders. This essentially left many regions under de facto rebel control. In these places partisans could walk in broad daylight. Today, in a small town north of Cervys, a rally was being held, in a show of complete impunity. Hundreds of civilians, many of whom carried flags with the Pomovarran boar, blended with armed resistance fighters on the town square.\nOlivier Morel climbed onto the improvised podium and looked at the crowd, enjoying the moment. As more and more griffons noticed him, they went silent, and soon all attention was on him.\n“Pomovarrans! My brothers and sisters!” he started, “Victory is near! The cowardly occupiers do not even dare to try and stop us anymore. In towns and villages across Pomovarra we grow stronger every day. Every day we liberate more and more of our homeland, every day more and more of our kin start living freely. It has been a long struggle. For generations, for hundreds of years we fought. We inherited the war of those who came before us, and it is our duty to fulfil the destiny which was stolen from them. When we go into glorious combat, remember: we do not fight only for ourselves, we fight for those who will inherit our legacy, we fight so they can live in a free Pomovarra, and we also fight in honour of those who fought before us. A hundred generations stand behind us, and a hundred more will come! Our victory is imminent!”"

goy_pomovarra.6.d:0 "A small vineyard, deep in the Pomovarran countryside, has been abandoned for a few years now. However, it was far from deserted. Bandits, smugglers and other riff-raff used it as a hideout from time to time. Today, its crumbling buildings became a meeting spot for Pomovarran rebels. Commanders of resistance squads gathered around a map, studying it closely. It ended up in their claws just a few days ago, when they ambushed a small military convoy, and it proved to be invaluable. On the map, current positions of the hostile army were shown, with plans for their movements. The air was thick with tension (and cigarette smoke), as the realisation of a golden opportunity came over the gathered officers.\n“Comrades,” Harmann Camriz pointed towards a point on the map, “This is probably our greatest finding in the last few months. With it, we can set up a trap on Reiher’s garrison. It seems he decided to move the bulk of his forces to Cervys to launch a raid on Westkeep. Our friends there informed me that a revolution is brewing in Aquileia. Surely, Reiher wants to use this opportunity. But before they arrive, his army is divided, and we have a strong presence in the city. We can split his forces in two and crush them, one after another. For this, we need to concentrate our soldiers for an assault. Are you with me on this?” Other griffons murmured approvingly.\n“I think it’s a good plan. But what about Morel, why isn’t he with us?” asked one of the officers.\n“As if I care...” Started Camriz, annoyed. Then continued, switching his tone, “Our dear friend and ally,” his voice was oozing with irony, “is busy with yet another of his tours across the countryside, galvanising the population – doing what he’s best at. But when it comes to strategy, I wanted an opinion of griffons with more military experience. Anyway, if we all agree on this plan, he will have to accept it – or make a fool of himself,” Camriz lit yet another cigarette, and after exhaling the smoke, continued, “And we can manage without his griffons, if he proves to be an insufferable idiot. Anyway, let’s discuss the details, shall we?”"

It’s all just a strap, isn’t it?” Reiher simply smiled in response. “Anyway, this is the bait, but how are you going to finish them off? By this plan, our forces will be stretched all across Pomazhon and Cervys.”\n“Well, you know, there is this little-known, forgotten depot south of Cervys. I have been discreetly stocking it up with equipment for the last few months, in preparation for the assault on Flowena. But then I realised that there’s a much better use for it. Rebels are unaware of its existence, and with them focused elsewhere, artillery from the depot can be moved to the city and concealed. When they attack, we will bring the sky down on them. They will never know what hit them...”\nAnd so, the plan was put in motion. Only one thing remained: to relay the order. A messenger was dispatched to the depot, carrying written commands from colonel Reiher. No-one could, however, predict that a sudden storm would force the griffon to go below the cover of clouds closer to the ground, where he was exposed. Neither could anyone predict that a small squad of Pomovarran partisans would set up camp nearby the flightpath. And so, the fate of the entire operation depended upon the sharp eyes and shooting skills of a rebel sentry. The griffon took aim – and..."

Now, in a carefully concealed command post, the colonel could witness the results of his plan. The city of Cervys was surrounded by heavily forested hills, a perfect spot to hide his artillery – further camouflaged with magic of unicorn magicians he managed to hire. Pomovarrans began their assault on the city from all sides, hoping to overwhelm the defences, supported from the inside by local sympathisers. While Reiher accounted for this eventuality, it was obvious that losses would be tremendous. Nevertheless, he chose the correct time to strike.\n“Begin bombardment. After it is done, all units will attack the sectors assigned to them,” Prince-colonel shouted to the nearby radio telegraphist. A minute later, when orders reached the artillery unit, dozens of cannons started to fire, one by one. Reiher pointed his binoculars at the valley below and smiled, seeing squads of rebel soldiers being annihilated, and remnants scattering. What followed was more of a slaughter than a proper battle – both the units formerly garrisoning the city and reinforcements hidden in the forest started their counter-attack. With a cigar in his beak, Reiher watched the spectacle. Everything went exactly as planned, and his subordinates knew what to do next. For now, he could fully enjoy this moment of triumph."

They seemed to go on forever and left him with a headache after... In part because of the horrible, cheapest cigarettes Camriz smoked all the time. Sometimes, Morel wondered if Camriz smoked even in his sleep. Nevertheless, he tried to stay polite – only the gods knowing how much of his sanity it cost him.\n“When we establish a government,” Morel started talking, “It is crucial to pick representatives based on traditional territorial divisions. This will reinforce local communities of...”\n“Departments are fine.” Camriz interrupted, “Just replace the officials, and things will run smoothly – as they have for decades. ‘Traditional divisions’, as you call them, haven’t existed for hundreds of years now. You want to restore the clans or what? Half of modern Pomovarrans can’t tell which of them they belong to anyway. I can’t tell myself. And if we go by this, you shouldn’t even be in government, as it was done by the right of blood – which you don’t have.” Camriz grinned and stubbed out his cigarette, lighting another one almost immediately.\n“You...” Morel hissed, “I have as much of a right to be here as you do!”\nHearing this, Camriz shrugged.\n“You brought up the issue, so reap what you sowed. Anyway, derailing the entire administration is a stupid idea for now. Not when we need to plan a campaign against Flowena. This is a very urgent issue, and we need a stable state to prepare for the conflict.”\n“I will let go of this issue for now.” As much as Morel hated it, his ‘brother in arms’ was correct. The time was not right. During discussion of more pressing matters, Morel had lost his focus. Though he fully realised now that Camriz was an obstacle.

Thus, finding a way to deal with him quietly proved to be a much more difficult task than Morel had first assumed. Camriz turned his new headquarters into a fortress – and when he travelled, he did so in a way so unpredictable that it was almost impossible to track. His soldiers were loyal, and trying to bribe one of them would be a foolish task. He took good care of them. But it was this immense care for his soldiers that created a vulnerability.\nAll that had to be done was to stage an attack on one of the more distant outposts, with assaulters posing as a roving band of deserters, one of many that still plagued the region. If the attack was strong enough, there was a chance that Camriz would want to personally handle the situation – or if it wasn’t, he would still come to visit the wounded soldiers in the hospital. And then, all that would be needed is one lucky shot.\nOf course, a few unlucky sods would die, but what are a couple deaths compared to a nation’s destiny? Thousands had died in the last three decades, so even a hundred more now would make no difference. Unfortunate, indeed..."

The rebels have captured most of the artillery positions, destroying the rest. And now, the city’s defences were being slowly overrun by their forces.\n“I guess it is time to retreat then,” Schattenzahn proposed with a sigh, “we will return to Pomazhon and plan a counter-attack...”\n“No,” the Colonel shook his head, “It’s over. This is an unmitigated, total disaster. With our losses here... There is no chance we can recover. I will lead an assault on Cervys as a diversion. You gatas many griffs as possible on the way, and go south. There, strip Pomazhon of everything you can get, and go straight to the verenian border. You will be able either to buy yourself safe passage, or find a new employment. Contact Cervys garrison through radio, and order them to attack northwards, if they are lucky, they might break through and maybe some of these poor sods will reach Adelart. Anyway, they have a better chance than staying here. SOLDIERS!” Colonel raised his voice, so everyone in camp could hear him. “We are going to relieve Cervys. Get your weapons and be ready in thirty minutes. I do not expect us to return, so whoever wills, may leave now.”\nMost of the soldiers decided to stay. Within half an hour a makeshift assault squad was formed. Among them, to his surprise, Reiher saw a certain diamond dog.\n“Didn’t I told you, you are supposed to go to Pomazhon?” asked Reiher.\n“Nah, I gave orders to my subordinates, they are clever enough to deal with it. Anyway, I’m not going to miss this. Never expected to be honest to live this long, so I may as well go with a bang” Dog grinned widely. “Also, I will finally pay my debt, colonel.”\n“Thanks... Old friend.” Responded Colonel. He took off an elaborate hat, his most recognisable symbol and casted it off into dirt. “Never liked to be a prince anyway...

But now, he knew what to do.\n“Call Bernez, he speaks the best Herzlandish here and knows their drill,” Camriz commanded his aide, “and give him one of the princely army uniforms.

Several units progressed further into Aquileia to attack railway lines, leading deep into the country, and do as much damage as possible to unprotected pieces of infrastructure like bridges and viaducts in order to delay the arrival of reinforcements. Following this, the bulk of our forces crossed the border with Weskteep, destroying isolated border posts and eliminating several Aquileian garrison units, isolating larger formations of their forces and generally causing as much chaos as possible. But rather than looting the entire region, they hit designated points of interest: major military factories, supply depots, warehouses with industrial goods, banks, and government buildings. Military engineers, following the vanguard units, were ordered to dismantle as much valuable industrial equipment as possible in order to sell it on the black market later.\nAs a result of the invasion, the Aquileian army in the region was put into complete disarray and couldn’t coherently respond to our attack, preoccupied with quelling local revolutionaries. After a week, when Aquileians reorganised, most of our units retreated from Westkeep, leaving only a small diversionary force to fool Aquileians. When the counter-attack finally happened, all Aquileians met were a few arriere-garde squads and local marauders.\nThe operation concluded with a resounding success, as we have secured a massive amount of funds, supplies, and military equipment with minimal losses, while also inflicting major casualties on the Westkeep garrison. However, we can expect that defence of the border will be reinforced, making another such daring raid an impossibility in the future."

We’ve been proven wrong. A large number of Reiher’s troops crossed the border with Westkeep, and after easily breaking through our defensive lines, took control over the region. However, their intentions weren’t to capture the territory. Instead, they focused on causing as much chaos as possible by attacking transportation and communication lines, isolating major army units.\nWhile under normal circumstances such an offensive would quickly grind to a halt due to complete disregard of logistics and presence of our army behind their back, this was not an invasion, but a raid with the sole goal of plundering as much as possible before we could react, organised by a professional army – not just bandits, we had previously thought Reiher commanded. Invaders swiftly retreated back into Pomovarra with the looted supplies before our counter-offensive could crush them. To prevent such an event from happening in the future, we will reinforce border posts and reorganise garrison units in Westkeep. We should remain wary of Reiher's future actions, as the ‘prince-colonel’ proved to be a much more dangerous enemy than we had imagined."

A prime example of a Flowenan patrician. With an underlying layer of cowardice for good measure. In short, a griffon Reiher could work with.\n“Prince, I am honoured that you accepted my request for a meeting.” The visitor tried to present himself as the personification of humility and gratitude, but his constricted movements, the slightly condescending tone of his voice – it all gave away how repulsive he found the situation. “Both you and I had been wronged by the rulers of Flowena, who failed to recognise the true greatness of us, rightful princes-”\n“Enough, de Bleuetaille.” Reiher waved his claw, silencing the fallen patrician. “I am not some naive maiden to be seduced with cheap compliments.” Hearing this, the patrician puffed angrily. Reiher continued, “You have been circling around Flowena like a hungry wolf ever since they banished you. And from what I know, you had brought it upon yourself. Plots are forgivable, this is Flowena, after all, but embezzlement of that much money in banks? I bet you’re surprised I know about this...” Reiher grinned. “My subordinate has a nose for digging up secrets, so to say. You are done, your actions could break the trust everyone around Griffonia has for the famed Flowenan banks. Now you are alone. What you had stolen, you have lost long ago in your quest for revenge. So, what can you offer me?”\n“It’s true, colonel, I stole a whole lot of money.” The patrician dropped his polite facade, his eyes now looked cold like two shards of ice. “And yes, I lost it – I’m much better at banking than conspiracies. But I see that you and your cronies have run Pomovarra into the ground. You know this, and you are almost as broken as I am. I can help you make this madhouse profitable – and what is even more important – I’ll get you all the gold from Flowenan banks, once you take the city. I know you’ll attack Flowena. But it won’t be only gold I’ll dig up for you. Only fools believe that the wealth of Flowena is hidden solely in its vault. There is much more... All the entries in Flowenan ledgers lead somewhere, to distant money and assets – both investments and ‘wellbeing insurances’ of Flowenan families. Others will never help you get those riches. You are an upstart in our eyes, a wild animal we lost control of. Not to mention that you will need help running the city to avoid turning it into Pomovarra number two.”\n“See, Antoine? Honesty is much better, straight to the point!” Reiher laughed. “You’re right, I’m horrible at ruling this place – not that the locals are much of a help... But tell me, what will you gain from it? And doesn’t working for an ‘upstart’ disgust you?”\n“Of course, it does,” responded de Bleuetaille plainly, “but I’m thrilled by the prospect of turning those who exiled me into beggars. I will be the last Flowenan patrician, and I’m sure you won’t be sated with just Flowena. Once will be done with your next conquest, I will be the richest griff in Flowena. And if you fear betrayal... Like I said, I'm a poor conspirator, and I learned this the hard way.”"

We suspect this to be a part of preparations for a direct attack, meant to soften our defences, terrorise the population, and check our determination.

The colonel tried to open his eyes, only to be blinded by daylight, coming through the open window. He blinked a few times and saw his bedroom completely trashed... And there was the source of that horrific sound – a small creature, half-cat, half-pigeon was cooing giddily while rummaging through a pile of scraps in the middle of the room. Somehow, a trashgriff has got inside. Reiher grabbed the nearest object – a metal paperweight – and threw it into the pest. Of course, he missed, but the animal jumped away, screeching in anger, and flew out into the streets. The colonel looked around. What once was an ornate bedroom looked as if a tornado had gone through it – with not a single piece of furniture left unscathed... And apparently, he hadn’t even made it into bed last night, lying on the floor, right next to it. The headache was horrible, and there was an ongoing rebellion in his stomach. He decided to follow old advice, he’d got from his uncle, ‘heal yourself with what had harmed you’... Luckily there was one intact bottle with some ruby liquid inside. Reiher grasped it and took a greedy swig...\n...Which proved to be a huge mistake. Moments later, he was at the window, puking outside. That was relieving. His head now hurt less, and memories were returning. They were at the victory parade yesterday, of course. Then they got into the mayor's palace and found his wine cellar... Then he drove a car around the city, shooting at monuments; lost the rest of the officers; found them, and they had more wine... Still, he was not sure how he ended up back inside the palace. And apparently, he had somehow lost his hat. Good. He never really liked it...\nBefore Reiher could recall more, the room’s doors opened – revealing Schattenzahn... with the lost hat in his paws! The dog’s nose instinctively wrinkled, hit with the strong smell of half-digested alcohol coming from his comrade, leaning on the wall. For a long moment, neither of the officers could say a word, until the diamond dog quietly sighed.\n“Leopold, Leopold. You go on a drunken spree in a just-captured city, get lost, shoot into random directions – and somehow end up not getting killed by the locals. Gods really must love idiots and drunkards. Anyway, you look like a piece of crap. And you were supposed to do some actual governing today, I think.”\n“Sure, sure...” mumbled Reiher, “make de Chamonile do it... he wanted to run Flowena anyway...”\n“De Bleuetaille,” the dog corrected him. “This is probably the best idea that’ll come out of you today.

A big desk he could put his legs on, a huge window, easy to throw bottles out of – with a good view of the garden too – and some old birds’ paintings on the wall that served as excellent dartboards. Of course, he never spent much time here, usually driving from one division to another and dealing with what actually mattered – his military campaign. The office was the domain of de Blautaille and good ol’ trusty Schattenzahn.\nReiher grabbed another dart, aiming it at the portrait right by the door. At this very moment, the door opened, revealing a grey dog. Surprised by his sudden entrance, Reiher threw the dart directly at him. Schattenzahn quickly raised the folder in his hands, deflecting the shot.\n“Really?” asked the former intelligence officer. “Well, a dart won’t kill me, but, please, refrain from shooting guns indoors. I’ve not yet mastered the art of catching bullets!”\n“Sorry,” murmured the colonel. “I won’t shoot, but I really like throwing things at this portrait, the guy in it looks both stupid and kinda familiar.”\n“It's old Bronzino. Don’t you remember the ‘guy’ who hired us to deal with Pomovarra all those years ago?”\n“Ah... so that’s why he seemed so familiar.” Reiher grinned. “And why I had this lingering thought, ‘this sure is some idiot bird’.”\n“You probably got him confused with his son, Chocolat. That one was a real fool. Though now that I think about it, Bronzino started the chain of events which ended with us looting his city – and you throwing darts at his portraits – so you might be right. Anyway, I have some bad news.” The diamond dog waved the folder full of files.\n“You know I hate reading reports; please, give me a quick summary.” Reiher took off his legs from the desk, and his grin disappeared.\n“So, we’ve only delayed the upcoming disaster. Sure, Flowenians hate us slightly less than Pomovarrans, but a rebellion’s already brewing. I can keep them at bay, but only for some time. I hope your plan is as good as you continue to say. Otherwise, locals will soon have our heads on pikes. And there is no way we can stop them. The funny side-effect of us relying on mercs and the black market is that, in time, weapons will also start flowing to various rebel groups.”\n“Got it. Yes, I am fully aware that what we’re running here isn’t sustainable – and it never will be. If we want to have a fighting chance against Aquileia, we must squeeze every bullet, every drop of fuel, and every nugget of gold out of this land. Their military and industrial capacity is several times larger than ours, but we don’t care about destroying it in the process like they do, as long as we take Aquila.” Reiher's usual facade of a merry drunk disappeared, his eyes cold as steel and focused. “Not to mention, we have the Empire, which seems to be digging itself out of the hole faster than I anticipated, breathing on our back. And there we have a death sentence – thirty years postponed. How much time do we have?”\n“Three years at best, maybe less.”\n“Noted. Do not worry, I have a plan – and trust me – we will yet celebrate its completion in the City of Lights.”"

What mattered then was survival, and the colonel managed to drag them all through the hell of the Revolution. Those who survived the madness of Verenia’s collapse stayed with Reiher after – they all owed his lives to his, at times, mad plans. Those days taught Schattenzahn to never question his new commander’s decisions. For the pup that he was then, it was not easy to desert the Reicharasmee. As a military intelligence officer, he got caught in a crossfire between various groups of rebels – and somehow ended up leading the defence of an insignificant garrison to which he’d been sent to ‘assess the situation’, all other officers had died or run away. With munitions running low, most soldiers wounded, and enemies surrounding his position, Heinrich could feel the approaching doom. And then, out of seemingly nowhere, a sudden attack broke the rebels’ line, sending them running away in panic to save their lives. As his requests for aid had been refused earlier, the attack could not have come from imperial forces. This was the day when he met Reiher for the first time, who was then riding from arsenal to arsenal, outpost to outpost with his regiment, stripping them down for weapons, munitions, and supplies on his march to the border with Verenia. Everyone who wanted to join were welcome to do so – and so Schattenzahn threw his lot in with the rogue officer – after all, if not for him, he would be dead.\nNow felt the same as then. Death was near, and enemies circled around them like hungry wolves. This time, however, there would be no miraculous help. Reports about rebel activities were piling up, almost every day there was a minor skirmish, ambush, or sighting of ‘suspicious activity’. Weapon smuggling got out of control, and the previously destroyed command network of the rebels was in the process of reconstruction.\nFor a brief moment, an intrusive thought entered his mind. Maybe it was time to bail out? Save himself while he still could? With his knowledge of smuggling routes and numerous black-market contacts, he could just disappear, forge a new identity and travel to any place where it was still safe. Perhaps, Nova Griffonia? Equestria was a bit too flashy for his tastes... He quickly suppressed the thought. If not for Reiher, he wouldn’t be even alive today – and he had to trust that his commander indeed had a good plan. He might have seemed – and in large part was – boisterous and irresponsible, but if there was one thing he was great at, it was improvising in unfavorable circumstances. Schattenzahn had become a traitor once already, and wasn’t planning on doing it again. He had to buy Reiher as much time as he could..."

When leaving Flowena, he barely had the time to take anything – and the map did not make it onto the list of items he managed to grab. Anyway, lack of fuel was a much more pressing matter. While the colonel could walk or fly, Schattenzahn could not. For now, he was lying on the back couch of the car, in a blissful unconsciousness caused by painkillers. That and a crude bandage was all Reiher could get to help his old friend, who had got shot in the belly. Colonel hoped they could find a doctor once they’d moved far enough away from Flowena – yet here they were, stuck in some godsforsaken forest. Once again, Reiher searched through the trunk, but there was not even a small canister of fuel in it. In a fit of anger, he kicked the back of the car. That achieved only one thing: awakened the wounded dog.\n“Where are we? Not in Flowena, right?” he whispered quietly.\n“No, we’re not. We left it a couple hours ago. I stopped to inflate a tire,” Reiher quickly came up with a convincing lie, carefully opening the passenger door to talk to his beat-up comrade.\n“Good... Good... Everything went south. And we’d been so close...”\n“So close...” repeated Reiher. “Damned be these Pomovarrans, Aquileians – or whatever these spawns of Maar are called. We were that close, Heinrich – that close to getting fabulously rich and leaving this place.”\n“It would be nice. But I took the bag with gold... The ‘just in case’ one...”\n“Good thinking. It can buy us passage to some nice, warm place. Macawia, perhaps... Oh, Macawia... We will drink the best rum, watch gorgeous sunsets while enjoying our retirement. It’s just a pity we will not be remembered as the most daring creatures in Griffonia. Now they will laugh at us, two old fools who lost to a bunch of poorly armed rioters. They’ll probably come up with an entire series of jokes about us, don’t you think?” There came nothing but silence in response. Reiher knew all too well what had happened.\nThe Colonel went back to the trunk, reached for the unassuming briefcase and opened it. Inside there were several gold ingots – enough to spend the rest of one’s life in luxury. Reiher closed it, sighed, pulled out a spade and started digging a hole right by the car. Half an hour later, when he’d finished burying the gold, he heard a distant roar of engines. The pursuit had caught up with them."

Colonel Reiher was already wearing a flowery shirt, while his most trusted subordinate simply unbuttoned his uniform.\n“I must say, Leopold, I never believed we would pull this off,” said the diamond dog. “This seems like a weird dream or a story from some stupid Equestrian adventure novel. And yet, you really did this.”\n“I told you, Heinrich! From the very beginning, I had a plan...”\n“Don’t lie to me, you had no plan. The whole way, it was complete madness, without any direction. This could end with a complete disaster at so many points... I don't even know where to start. You are either the luckiest bastard in the entire world or literally a chosen of the gods.

And now we will enjoy our early retirement in a nice, warm place!” Soldiers started cheering, and after a moment chanting,\n“Rei-her! Rei-her!

Not much of a loss, after several colonel’s parties, the palace stopped looking as nice, and ultimately, Antoine had the best one. From it, the patrician ruled his little fiefdom, Pomovarra. Between planning wars and partying, the colonel had no time to pay attention to what his pocket patrician did. His damn diamond dog bodyguard was more problematic, but as long as he got the money they needed, he asked few questions. And so started a giant money laundering operation. De Bleuetaille squeezed Flowena to the last idol, probably bankrupting several other warlords’ retirement funds – but it simply had to be this way to satisfy both his and Reiher’s needs. He knew this would end. His ‘Prince’ was a fool, and while tactics of running away from problems worked for him for now, they would catch up to him one day.\nHe had failed to predict one thing. That Reiher would just throw someone out of the metaphorical coach to be devoured by his problems and drive away off into the sunset. Cheeky bastard! His soldiers just sacked Aquila, stole several ships, and left the country with whatever they had in their claws. Now Reiher and his trusted officers were enjoying life on some tropical paradise, while the country was rapidly collapsing into complete chaos. The army of mercenaries and bandits he had amassed was grand, but with their commander gone, they were surrounded by hordes of angry griffons. Clever ones just followed their leader's example. Stupid ones stayed to loot what little still remained. Meanwhile, de Bleuetaille realised that he’d overstayed his welcome. Even from his palace, he could hear distant explosions. Mercenaries on his payroll have long ago stopped defending the city. Now, they were loading valuables and supplies on trucks, in hopes of getting to Skyfall.

De Bleuetaille, perplexed, turned on the radio receiver standing in the corner of his office, and instantly, a voice came through,\n“Comrades! Soldiers of the Revolution! All throughout the country, from Aquila to Flowena, we are rising against oppression! Fires of the revolution rage, consuming the old and ushering a new age! Rise! Fight! Grab a gun and kill every soldier of the enemy, every collaborating official, every traitor.

And in this, Allard could see his golden opportunity. While most Aquileian leaders were overcoming their shock, he acted first – and acted decisively. All that was needed was a small group of agitators, a revolutionary vanguard, able to mobilise and direct the angry masses. And with him and his followers always being on the outskirts of Aquileian politics, they were the ones least affected by the devastation of Aquileia and seeking opportunities wherever they could arise.\nNow, Aquila was his.

The few that did not, and tried to argue against their charges, earned an extrajudicial execution on the spot. Of course, everything had to be in order, and one of the clerks left the courtroom to write their posthumous sentences, ‘execution for disobeying direct orders of a Representative of the People’. Sometimes, screams could be heard from the backyard of the building, along with sounds of trucks approaching or leaving.\nInside, three griffons were doing their best to deal with the entire batch of prisoners today. They could waste no time, as they’d been informed the next batch of prisoners would arrive tomorrow. Of course, it would be easier to execute them all on the spot, but law had to be maintained even when dealing with such despicable criminals.\n“Next!” ordered the head judge. Guards dragged a beat-up pony dressed in torn military uniform inside. “Name? Rank? Unit?”\n“Stift Wing, corporal, Floppen’s Finest. I was just–”\n“Only answers to direct questions!” the griffon raised his voice; then turned to his assistant, “Is he on the list?”\n“Yes, captured along the remainder of his unit.”\n“Good. You have committed numerous cases of murder, armed robbery, crimes against civilians, treachery against Aquileia, and... And that’s enough for a death sentence. Francois, do you agree?” The griffon asked the other judge who was rummaging through a mountain of papers, looking for something.\n“What? Ah, yes, the cat mercs. They were a nasty bunch. Execution!”\n“But I was just a truck driver!” screamed the pony, struggling against the firm grip of his guards. As he was being dragged outside to be hanged, Francois finally found the piece of paper he’d been looking for.\n“Hm, we might want to slow down the executions,” he said to the head judge. “I’ve just found a request for a hundred prisoners to clear rubble in Rila.

Tables from all over the palace were dragged into the former ballroom to prepare a spot for delegates – many were anticipated to arrive. To everyone’s surprise, Victor Allard announced his willingness to cooperate with the leaders of other political parties and influence groups from around Aquileia in hopes of avoiding infighting at this darkest hour. Though some distrusted Allard, claiming that he probably plans only to use them as puppets in an attempt to take total control over the nation, most were cautiously optimistic. The room was slowly filling. Griffon assembled in small groups, discussing plans for the future, with their host still nowhere to be seen. Twenty minutes after the designated time, Victor Allard, flanked by several of his most trusted associates, all wearing similar black uniforms, entered the ballroom.\n“Gentlegriffs, I’m pleased to see you all here on this fateful day. Please, take your seats.” As griffons moved, Allard’s eyes darted from one delegate to another, as if he were counting them.\n“Before we start, where is our dear Leonard?” Allard asked an MPA member.\n“Le Maréchal refused to participate. He said...” the griffon hesitated. “that he does not want to be in the same building, preferably, the same city, as you.”\n“A sentiment we both share.” Allard shrugged, extending his arms. “I must admit though, old Rodier is quite smart. Thanks for pointing out that he is likely not in Aquila. As I can see, except for him, and this coward Verany, everyone’s here. Good. It will make things much easier.”\n“Easier? What’s on your mind, Victor?” Devereux asked, clearly surprised.\n“You see, my dear Thibault, I’m happy to welcome you to the first and last meeting of the Committee in such a wide and ideologically diverse form.” At this moment, the rest of the doors opened, and guards armed with machineguns swarmed the room. “For too long, you have been leeching on Aquileia. Wasn’t this the second time you all managed to completely fail our country? Do you really believe I would let you do so the third time? Preposterous! You are all under arrest for a criminal level of incompetence and/or treason. The court will decide what you are guilty of specifically.” The entire room fell silent.\n“Treason?” Cécile Gaudreau was the first one to regain the ability to speak. “You are the traitor here, Allard! You betrayed the Revolution! You betrayed the Republic! And you betrayed your colleagues! You are a power-hungry maniac, who has somehow tricked us all!”\n“The Revolution was always flawed, and so was the Republic,” answered Allard calmly. “The only crime, I’m guilty of, is being a fool for so long, believing I can work within the existing order. Now I see that it must be torn down, and all its vestiges burnt to ashes. Anyway, I’m a very busy griffon.”"

Carefully claw-picked ones would be tried publicly – the spineless ones who would surely break down and provide a good show; something a radicalised crowd loves to see, something that would make them despise their former leaders even more.\nAs for the rest, it was simple: every high-ranking MPA member would be executed on sight – they were too dangerous, every so-called ‘socialist’ would undergo a review of their ideology’s orthodoxy, then either being executed or sent to a re-education camp. These bourgeois in communist disguise were even worse than actual capitalists, as they could undermine the Revolution from within! For the lowest-level politicians, options were numerous: imprisonment, aforementioned re-education camps, redemption brigades... Allard worked tirelessly, signing sentences.

Michael sometimes wondered why he hadn’t left for some other place while it was still easy – some faraway country, where there was still some sanity. But he simply could not let this continue. While most seemed to either buy into the communard rhetoric or simply followed it out of apathy or fear, Michael could not stand Aquileia descending into this nightmare. Before all this started, he considered himself a socialist, always voting for PAT. But this was not how a workers’ state was supposed to look. On his way from the railway station, he passed three different ‘Le Patron’ posters, depicting Allard as a saviour of the Revolution, along with an armed patrol, beating some unlucky griffon into a pulp. The whole affair was related to that poster, as said griff was apparently trying to paint a moustache onto the face of the ‘Glorious Leader’. Though he was lucky to end up just beaten, and not outright shot.\nMichael’s job of a low-level railway inspector let him travel freely across Aquileia, not raising much suspicion – perfect cover for a courier. He, and several other griffons, helped coordinate a disparate assembly of opposition leaders – what little remained of them. His trip to Rila had been fruitful, now he was transporting a large dossier about recent operations of the secret police, which would hopefully make evading their agents easier in the future. On his way to the hideout, Michael had to pass a small plaza. Once, in its centre stood a statue of an Aquileian king – recently demolished, of course, like every other piece of ‘royalist propaganda’. On its spot now stood the gallows. About a dozen bodies of both griffons and ponies lightly swayed in the wind... Apparently, summary executions by firing squads or guillotine weren’t enough. Now lifeless bodies of ‘counter-revolutionaries’ would be left as a grim reminder of what awaits potential ‘traitors’. Michael had almost passed by the cruel display... But suddenly, he recognized one of them. It was his contact in the city! Michael stood there frozen in shock and fear. Next to him there was an old pony shopkeeper, whose grocery store was next to their hideout. The last of the hanged creatures was a local judge known for passing relatively soft sentences – work camp stints, instead of executions. The regime devoured one of its loyal dogs. Michael felt a brief moment of satisfaction... After a moment, replaced by fear. He had to run! And get rid of the dossier. If they had got his contact, then–\n“No need to run, citizen,” he heard a calm, tired voice behind his back. Slowly turning towards it, he saw three griffons in uniforms of the political police.

On the opposite wall, a simple board used to display images from slide projectors has been placed. The projector itself, a marvel of magitek engineering, was possibly the only truly fancy piece of equipment in the room. But considering how extensively it was used, it was only right to use the best available piece of technology. A dozen griffons sat on both sides of the table – members of Allard’s inner circle, true rulers of the Commune.\n“...a comprehensive list of property and artifacts is still being prepared, chairgriffon,” one of the members was continuing his long tirade. “It will be finished within a week and delivered to the members of this plenum. Losses caused by looting during the recent campaign caused delays. The Ministry of Infrastructure has already provided me with a list of projects which could use a delivery of extra materials to be completed.”\n“Excellent!” Allard quickly went through the list he’d been given. “Approved. As soon as the survey is completed, proceed with the plan, we can use every bit we can squeeze out, and it will also create a powerful message: from remnants of our bourgeois past, we will forge useful tools for the Commune.”\n“Is this really necessary, chairgriffon?” another member, an older griffon, suddenly spoke. “I do not fancy relics of the royal age myself, but nevertheless they are symbols of the power and triumphs of Aquileia. Not to mention, economic benefits of the entire operation would be minimal.”\n“Elimination of those responsible for the recent failures and national stabilisation earned us more than enough goodwill within the society,” added another griffon. “We might lose it, if we proceed too fast with unpopular policies. We need serenity on the inner front, so that we may prepare to fight reactionaries across Griffonia. Could we delay the project until these issues are resolved?”\n“So, you are calling for an evolutionary change.” Allard grinned. “I’d like to remind the members of this Committee that the powers and triumphs these buildings and monuments remind us of are ones of reactionaries and monarchists, and that by associating ourselves with them, we would suggest that our Revolution is heir to the rotten state that came before it. By delaying the change, we risk setting the precedent that every time a matter is brought to this Committee, it would be disregarded, until the provisional state becomes permanent.

Temple buildings are to be demolished or used in ways, beneficial to local communities or to the sate – for example, as storage spaces.\nAfter the recent series of purges, no groups able to organise actual resistance against the new law remained. However, spontaneous protests erupted across the nation, with many religious griffons trying to defend their local temples from the political police. In the coming days, they would be crushed, and the situation returned to normalcy... Mostly.\nWe are receiving a growing number of reports about strange occurrences. Weather becomes increasingly erratic, with both pegasii weather specialists and unicorn mages unable to explain or combat it.

It was only recently that he found a new use for the room.\nIn the darkness of the night, hooded griffon figures were entering the building. It was dangerous to come here, yet the group met every few weeks. Several workers from nearby factories and warehouses, like Jean, their family members and friends all met here despite the danger of prosecution. In this basement, a makeshift chapel had been built. A symbol of the Three hanged on the wall, and all the tools needed for sermons were stored in an old cupboard. Jean welcomed each of the faithful, waiting for the most important griff to appear. He was late today. This worried Jean, as he’d been usually the first to arrive. What if he got caught... No doubt, he would rather die than betray the group. But his capture would be a painful blow. Finally, from the dark, a figure emerged.\n“Sorry, I’m late. Our shifts were extended, and it’s better not to slack off these days...”\n“If it’s a problem, we might stop the meetings until things get a bit easier. I’m sure everyone would understand,” responded Jean.\n“No, no... I’ll manage. They need this. We all need this. Let’s begin.” Two griffons entered the basement after him. The belated griffon put on priestly robes, and soon, the sermon began. He was no proper priest. He’d left the seminary after three years of studies. Upholding moral values proved to be difficult for the young griff... This ended up being a blessing in disguise, as his record was purged, so there was nothing to arrest him for.\nHe may have not been a proper priest, but he was the best they had, and he knew he had to step up to the plate. It was Jean, his old friend, who had contacted him and asked if he would lead their little group. And ever since, in this cramped basement, he repeated ancient prayers and conducted religious ceremonies to the best of his ability.\n“We call upon the Three to provide us with guidance,” griffons repeated words of prayer after their priest, “Eyr, bless us to endure the sufferings of the world.

Material obtained during the entire action would be used in planned construction projects.\nIn the following weeks, makeshift squads of ‘purgers' formed, going from home to home in search for anything they deemed unrevolutionary: works of art, books, elaborate furniture – all of this would fuel giant pyres on city plazas for many days to come, in the process of the Communard regime excising its Aquileian past in an orgy of mass destruction. Across museums and galleries of the state, only a few relics were spared; ones that could be useful for the development of magical weapons.

Newly raised monuments, usually depicting workers and soldiers, often in the process of slaying some monstrously distorted enemies of the Revolution, also included these words in one form or another. The view from Lambert's office was great. He could see the plaza on which so-called ‘unity gatherings’ were occurring. Masses of griffons converged, coming from adjacent streets, many of them carrying red banners. A speaker stood on the podium, and in something resembling a mockery of religious ceremonies was reading excerpts from the collected works of ‘Le Patron’. But the best attraction, the ‘Self-Critique Ceremony’, came after. Guards escorted recently captured prisoners onto podium, where they begged for mercy, claiming they have understood the error of their ways and crimes against the Commune, bringing the crowd into some sort of zealous frenzy. Lambert wouldn’t lose any sleep over these horrors. He’s never been a religious griffon, and counter-revolutionaries being publicly humiliated only warmed his heart... But one thing bothered him.\nThe slogan had not been written in Aquileian, but in this new ‘Lingva Communara’, as Allard called it. It was a deranged butchery of major languages of Griffonia – mostly of Aquileian and Karthinian – with a small dose of Herzlandish mixed in. Apparently, a group of linguists worked over the last few months to create this ‘new language for new creatures’, as the Leader said during the last Committee session. Lambert struggled to maintain composure back then. But he managed, knowing what tended to happen to those who disagreed with Allard. Now he was going through a detailed report about planned changes which he had to check before the next session. Each new paragraph he read appalled him more than the last. Apparently, Le Patron intended to actually introduce this new ‘language’ into administration and public schooling, with a minimal transitory period. But besides that, there was also a detailed plan of changing the number of days in a week to ten, planned changes to names of settlements across Aquileia – down to the smallest town – In the following years, a new list of government-approved names for chicks, beginning with ‘Caramarksa’... The document went on and on. Lambert could only imagine the complete disarray all this would throw administration into. He sighed heavily. Things were getting out of claw. It was definitely not what he signed up for when he became a member of the Committee. To let his eyes rest, the councilgriffon looked out the window...

One less reactionary!\nHowever, the situation in Rila has been growing unstable some time already. The city’s population, especially its ponies, known for their royalist sentiment, was harbouring a growing resentment to our rule. Rila, once a prosperous city, fell on hard times recently. Destruction of the Great Temple of Arcturius galvanised the faithful, and many yearned for return of the ‘good old days’ of the monarchy, back when things were seemingly going into a better direction. And so, a passerby came to help his compatriot. Soon after him, another joined the fray, and then another... Soon, the policemen found themselves assaulted by a crowd of angry griffons and ponies who eventually tore them to pieces.\nPerhaps the situation could still be defused, perhaps locals would disperse, fearing reprisal. But then a griffon whose name was not remembered by history climbed onto the nearest street lantern and screamed,\n“We are all dead griffs walking! They will hunt us down and kill for this! I will not wait, I will rather die fighting, as every true Aquileian should!”\nThe galvanised group marched to the local police station, being reinforced on each street intersection by more disgruntled Rilans. Before they reached their destination, the mob grew to the size of a large crowd. Policegriffs did not try to resist and ran away, leaving behind their weapons...\nBefore the end of the day, Aquileian flags were hanging all over major points of Rila. The local garrison joined the growing revolt, providing it with the armaments and organisation it needed, and then our control over the city was truly lost..."

Local command pulled back whatever forces remained loyal towards Dilven and requested assistance,” Lambert retold the recent events to members of the Committee. “We have received a message from them, the ‘Rilan Free Government’, as they’ve taken to calling themselves. They want to negotiate and present their demands–”\n“There will be no negotiations!” interjected Allard. “Agreeing to any kind of communications would encourage any wannabe reactionary rebels to act. Any such action must be put down with extreme violence as fast as possible to discourage any future rebellions. Rila was always a dangerously reactionary city, even their ‘republicanism’ was poisoned and twisted more than on average. Order the envoy to be shot and contact the general staff. Rila must be captured, and we must ensure that this incident remains isolated. Is that all?”\n“Yes, chairgriffon,” responded Lambert.\n“Good. And you can tell the bleeding hearts in the staff that they’re free to soften up the defences as they please before the assault. In fact, I encourage them to do so. As an inherently reactionary city, it would be best if Rila was demolished completely anyway...” Allard tapped his claw on the table. “Now, excuse me, I have other important matters to take care of. We will end the meeting for today.” As Allard was leaving the room, Lambert gave one last look to the report he hadn’t finished reading in the morning. The list of rebels’ demands was rather short: amnesty for them, repeal recently passed ‘cultural laws’, allow personal religious practices. When he raised his eyes from the paper sheets, he could see other Committee members starting to leave the room. No doubt, most of them at this point could perfectly read the thoughts and feelings of their leader, predicting his moods and responding accordingly. A few of them were probably genuine in their fanatical devotion to ‘Le Patron’, Yet, Lambert saw something akin to sparks in the eyes of some creatures in the room, ones of disgust and fear..."

goy_pomovarra.127.d:0 "While smoke was visible from many miles away, it was inside the city that one could see the full extent of the destruction. It seemed as if not one building in Rila had avoided damage, most turned into piles of rubble. Lambert read the reports; rebels decided to fight to the last griff, and when the first assault on the city failed, ‘indiscriminate bombardment’ commenced. There was not much more to be gleamed from the reports. Reality showed a much grimmer picture. He had been sent here to personally oversee the progress of the ‘sweeping operation’, as Le Patron was not fully trusting the reports delivered by the High Command and wanted a ‘second opinion’. As his vehicle approached the city, the disturbing visuals were complemented by olfactory experience, namely the horrible stench of smoke, burned and rotting bodies, and the lingering acidic smell of magical spells and chemical weapons, used to ‘pacify’ the city. At some point, it became unbearable, and Lambert leaned out of the window and vomited on the street. Finally, the car reached the ‘headquarters’ of general Duval, assigned to dealing with Rila’s ‘problems’. One of the few surviving buildings in the area, once probably a warehouse, was bustling with activity. Squads were leaving for patrol duty around the city, groups of prisoners were being formed into columns to be marched to labour camps... The look in the eyes of both soldiers and prisoners could not go unnoticed. It was as if something broke in them, and now they were simply going with the motions like automatons.\nIt took some time before he was finally directed to Duval. The general occupied what was probably once the manager's office. Air was thick with cigarette smoke, and Lambert caught the general leaning back on the chair, staring somewhere into the distance, apparently lost in his thoughts. Gabriel Duval had been sent to Rila in recognition for his organisational talents, needed to turn the hasty retreat into an assault once again, later tasked with taming the rebellious city. A few silent seconds passed before Duval noticed the visitor."

Or rather, what remains of it?”\n“You should be aware of it, comrade general. A message had been issued before I left the capital. I am here to personally assess the situation in the city and the progress of pacification.”\n“Right, right,” mumbled Duval. “We have a lot on our claws here, but yes, I’ve read the message – and so has my... comrade commissar...” There was a hint of venom in his voice when he said ‘comrade’. “We both sent detailed reports, all details included. Organised resistance is quelled, now we’re just mopping up.”\n“And where is the commissar-general, if I may ask?”\n“Hm... probably a few miles away from here with others, delivering sentences and commenting on my reports from a safe position.” Antipathy of officers to the decomptage system which assigned each of them with a commissar, meant to oversee their actions and maintain ‘ideological purity’, of the soldiers was well-known. “I’m surprised you are not talking to him, instead taking the risk to come here. There is still, though miniscule, the threat of an attack by some desperates. Care for a drink, comrade? I found a bottle of wine inside this desk. So we can... well... celebrate victory.” Lambert nodded, and after pulling one of the chairs closer to the table, sat in front of the general. Duval, after a minute of searching, gave up on trying to find a second glass, and shrugging, poured wine for the envoy.\n“No place for bourgeois manners, I guess,” said Duval, drinking his dose straight from the bottle. Lambert raised the glass and tasted the wine. It was... obviously cheap and very sour.\n“Ugh, I’m not surprised why this bottle survived,” said Duval, noticing his visitor’s disgusted expression. “Must be some cheap, local one. I do not recognise the label. Anyway, we had to burn the vineyards, while moving closer to the city, to deprive rebels of cover. So, hopefully, it's the last bottle of this abomination.”\n“Comrade Allard proposed to demolish all surviving vineyards,” suddenly said Lambert melancholically. “Alcohol poisons the body of the proletariat, he said, and there are better ways to utilise the land... or something like that – I didn’t listen afterwards. So we might as well enjoy this abomination while we still can.”\nThe look on Duval’s face changed, a sudden flash of life appearing in his eyes. “Just don’t say ‘something like that’ when you talk to my co-commander. He is rather zealous about every word of Le Patron. As for me, I’m a bit more... flexible. And discreet. As are some other griffons in the High Command, not that I can name them. It’s a pity that we might be enjoying the last pieces of old, bourgeois decadence, which so greatly boost morale. I wonder, do you share our appreciation of wine, comrade?”\nLambert slowly blinked, surprised by the general's words, and then downed the glass."

Then he was given a tour of the city, where he could personally witness the ongoing destruction of the symbols of the dead Empire.\nThere was one last thing to deal with, the Child-Emperor. Of course, there was no doubt he had to be executed. Generally, the life of a single griffon was meaningless, but Grover was not just a griffon. When one of the officers expressed worry about reaction of the locals to the execution of a child (Allard then made a mental note to send him to the Redemption Brigades), his response was simple; it does not matter whether Grover is a griffon child, an elderly pony, or a squirrel – he is a symbol of a reactionary regime, and as such, much be destroyed.\nThere was no need to further discuss the matter or visit the palace to talk with the last Griffonian Emperor.

Following our recent actions, the local population was brought into a state of frenzy, no doubt, galvanised by local reactionary politicians. A massive uprising began. With partisans strongly supported by the population, our garrisons got quickly overwhelmed. Rebel activity within the region was already high, thanks to difficult terrain, but now we are facing an all-out revolt. However, the situation is unlikely to develop any further, as we are already moving regular divisions into the region. CRA Command has requested permission to proceed with the pacification plan ‘Tunneler’. A sufficient amount of chemical weapons has been secured for the emergency, as they were deemed to be the best solution for dealing with a population highly resistant to all forms of communist re-education."

A direct assault of a major resistance centre in the fortified city of Ravensburg was deemed too costly. Per suggestion of commissar Merle, an incendiary bombardment was commenced on residential areas to allow for easier takeover of the industrial district.”\nThe city burned for three days. Conventional bombardment demolished districts surrounding the industrial park to ensure fire would not spread. For a long time, locals were trying to put down flames, only for new ones to be started from shelling by communist artillery. Left powerless, defenders could only watch their city getting slowly consumed by fire. Their only respite was that they evacuated most of the civilian population to safe mountain cities... On the fourth day, in an underground bunker, the few remaining officers decided they would rather die fighting than burn alive. And so, the remaining defenders sallied out in their last, hopeless charge, running straight at machine guns. Mad griffons and dogs, emerging from the thick smoke, resembled rather demons than normal mortals...\n“Following the siege of Ravensburg, the army proceeded with encircling underground cities of Bronzehill’s interior. Diamond Dogs evacuated the majority of the population into them, alongside weapons and supplies. Ventilation shafts have been identified, and extra entry points were created for the use of chemical weapons.”\nDeath was slow to come; gas was spreading from one chamber to another in the underground city of Kaza-Gull. Aquileian engineers were methodical. Attempts to seal already poisoned sections off were of no help, as more and more shafts were appearing, with gas descending through them. Within hours, a city once bustling with activity turned into a mass grave, its underground halls filled with corpses, laying in unnatural, twisted poses.\n“In several locations, surviving rebels repelled following assaults and collapsed sections of the underground cities, specifically targeting valuable industrial sections and treasure chambers.”\n“To Tartarus with them!” The burly diamond dog soldier huffed angrily behind a gas mask which saved his life. “They keep coming and coming. No matter how many we kill, they press on!”\n“They want to take our treasures! Not just kill us, but also steal everything, so they could further the misery of everyone on the continent,” added his griffon companion grimily.\n“Then we will take the treasures to the grave! Contact lieutenant Schwarz and tell him to bring as many explosives as possible to the western pylon. They’ll get nothing from this!”\n“Plan Tuneller has been successfully completed, with all major resistance centres pacified. Remaining rebel cells in mountainous areas still continue to harass our forces, but can pose no threat to the regional garrison, and will be eliminated in the next phase of the operation.”\nVictor Allard finished reading through the report and put it into the ever-growing pile of documents on his desk."

The same you all had!” The other members remained silent, as if paralyzed by the speaker’s honesty. The reason why such a moment even happened was obvious: this time Victor Allard was not among them, personally visiting Pridea to review the performance of the Communard Navy. “Riverlands are far from what could be considered ‘pacified’, and unless we literally bomb every mountain and forest there, it will take us years – maybe decades – to deal with revolts. Not to mention that our griffon territories are far from calm. We cannot just firebomb every rebelling city...” At this point the speaker fell silent, realising that if their leader was here, his opinion would be completely opposite. Moments later, the unfortunate griffon realised what he just did; that he has just become a dead avian – still breathing and walking, but for all intents and purposes, already dead. The unfortunate griff’s claws started to shake uncontrollably.\n“Ahem...” another Committee member cleared his throat. “Maybe we will omit this from the meeting’s protocol and go to the next point.

goy_pomovarra.126.d:0 "Shores of Asterion were full of cozy bays. Well-hidden from sight, they weren’t often visited by anyone other than locals. And for hundreds of years, these places were a haven for seafaring outlaws – like Konstantinos who, in his youth, was a smuggler. For many years he thought that he’d left this part of his past behind, but now the skills and contacts he’d acquired then became useful once more – just not in the name of money...\nA small group of minotaurs, carrying huge backpacks, was silently traversing overgrown mountain pathways. The trek was difficult even for hardened bulls, but thanks to that, invaders did not bother to patrol it. Climbing onto the last hill, Konstantinos saw darker space below: the bay. And amidst it, a small dot of light... The old smuggler cursed under his breath and hastened his companions with a gesture. They had to move fast.\nA small boat hovered by the coast. A tall harpy was leaning on the railing, chainsmoking. When Konstantinos cleared his throat, the bird jumped, dropping a cigarette into the water.\n“What the–” Screamed the harpy, trying to pull out his gun with shaky hands... And then dropped it on the deck.\n“Calm down, Pedro, or you will die of a heart attack. And for gods’ sake, don’t smoke! You know from how far a fire can be seen during such a dark night? And griffs have very good eyesight, you should know.”\n“Whatever, sure,” mumbled the harpy.\n“The only thing that’s for sure is that they’ll shoot on sight. They don’t play nice. But no time to talk. We have one more load for you to transport.”\n“What is it this time?” Asked Pedro, having regained his composure.\n“Books from the Prospero library...” Konstantinos clenched his fists. Griffons had burned it to the ground... Luckily, they did not know about the catacombs below, where minotaurs stored as many books as they could before the city fell.\n“Sure, I’ll bring them to the same minotaurs as before.” Old partners watched silently as the rest of the group dragged their bags into the ship's hold. “You know, I could take you and your friends to Zerbica, too. Asterion is not a nice place for business anymore... Well, not a nice place for anything,” suddenly said the harpy, “free of charge for an old partner.”\n“This would be the first time you ever did something for free, Pedro.” The minotaur laughed. “Watch out, you might start singing about friendship if this goes on... But no. Thanks for the offer, but there’s still much we need to do here.”\n“Save some dusty, old books?”\n“Save what we are. Our culture. Without it, we will become slaves to a mad griffon dictator. Creatures with neither past, nor future... I read their manifesto, you know? That’s what they want to turn us into – to turn everyone into. I will not allow it. Anyway, it’s not safe to stay here for long. Have a safe journey, Pedro.”\nAs the harpy sailed out of the bay, he watched the minotaurs disappearing into the forest. He did not fear the coastal guard, he’s been running circles around them for years now. Yet he had a certain ominous feeling... That it might be the last time he would see his old friend."

Of course, in this gruelling process, many griffons had died. Some resisted while being kicked out of their homes, and got shot. Others starved on trains due to mismanagement of supplies. Now the city was home only to a few stragglers who hid within the vast maze of its buildings, the Great Tree’s branches, and tunnels underneath and to looters – both deserters from the communard army and regular bandits, fighting for remaining scraps. Encompassing the whole place, was an overbearing feeling of dread, reinforced by an ever-growing number of soldiers outside the city. But despite these obvious signs, there was also something supernatural about it.\nThe Great Tree was massive – truly enormous – and as every even barely competent mage could say, it was a place of powerful magic, too. It would not be easy to destroy it. Nevertheless, a plan was outlined, a number of structural weaknesses identified, and extensive preparations made. Due to the magical nature of the place, conventional means of destruction would be used to avoid causing a dangerous magical disaster. The bombardment lasted for hours, as hundreds of cannons showered the Great Tree with high-explosive and incendiary rounds. As the tree finally caught fire, the air filled with thick smoke. At this moment, several mages, appointed to assist the operation, requested an immediate retreat, claiming that the flow of magical energies in the area had been disturbed and started affecting the fabric of reality – pointing to, as examples, the unnatural number of malfunctions of artillery pieces, which seized up, failed to fire, or in many cases exploded catastrophically, taking their crews away with them. But the commanding officer did not relent, as if in a trance, claiming that retreating “from a fight with a damned tree” would be a complete disgrace for the Revolution and its soldiers.\nThe day was coming to an end when they heard a crack loud enough to make almost completely deafened artillerygriffs stop loading new rounds into their guns. Thousands of soldiers stood frozen, watching the Great Tree starting to break. While some of them were cheering, many just stood silently in awe of the ancient city falling.\nAnd as the first branches fell to the ground, the earth started to shake, and the mountain on which the Great Tree stood started crumbling. Nearest positions of the assembled army were swept right away by an avalanche of stone and fiery wood, while farther away, griffs were thrown around by the sudden earthquake. When the disaster ended, the Communard army was left in disarray, yet their goal had been achieved.\nGriffonstone was no more.\nFar in the distance, a single hooded griffon-shaped figure observed this moment. The giant bonfire that the tree had turned into failed to light the darkness beneath its hood. The creature quietly cackled... As if its joy was mixed with fear... Then, before anyone could witness it, the hooded figure disappeared..."

Shelves were filled with meticulously marked folders; the system used to mark them understood only by the room’s usual occupant. Piles of papers on the huge desk might have seemed chaotic at first glance, but there was some inner logic in how they covered the surface – and Allard has never lost a single document he was working on. A huge blackboard directly in front of his view was covered in words, symbols, and lines, depicting some abandoned thought processes – he had used it to visualise plans during their development. Everything seemed exactly the same as the day he left for Pridea. The trip was uneventful and not really satisfying. Many reports from the Admiralty were apparently filled with half-truths and wishful thinking, leaving a lot to be done in preparation for the invasions of Equus and Zebrica. The first thing, of course, was to order a proper investigation into mismanagement of the navy – and punish the culprits. An issue to present during today’s Committee meeting came to his mind. Hopefully, his subordinates were ready to come up with a way to quickly bolster the readiness of the armed forces...\nAllard sat behind the desk and opened the lock securing a carafe on his desk. He poured a glass of water from it and raised the glass to his beak. Then, a sudden thought crossed his mind; was the carafe standing exactly in the same place as he’d left it? No, it was just exhaustion, making him paranoid... After all, he hasn’t been here in a while, and the unicorn artificer assured him that every poison added inside would turn into harmless water... Calmed down, Allard emptied the glass in one gulp. Next few minutes he spent reading some overdue reports...\nAnd then he felt a sudden stroke of pain, as if his insides were burning like a living flame.

What do we do?!”\n“Calm down!” Duval raised his voice only slightly. “Attention, soldier, report properly!”\n“Yes, sir...” A simple command brought the guard back from a state of panic. “A clerk brought a new batch of documents to chairgriffon Allard’s office at five, as always. Then she screamed that our leader was dead. Me and corporal Faucon entered the room and found Le Patron on the floor, unconscious. I ran straight here to report this.”\n“So, you did not check if the chairgriffon is really ‘dead’? Maybe he just fainted?” The general inquired further.\n“No, sir, I...” mumbled the soldier.\n“Idiot...” The officer sighed. “Gentlegriffs, we should check what is actually happening – as fast as possible.

A unicorn medic could surely help him. General Duval, you’ve ordered your soldiers to prepare a car, where are they–”\nAt this moment, gunshots sounded from somewhere in the distance, in the maze of rooms and corridors.

Sadly, Le Patron died before he could be transported to the hospital. What a shame.

Everyone in the room froze as if they were rabbits facing a hungry wolf. Le Patron led his eyes around the entire group, his gaze filled with cold fury and pure hatred. He tried to say something, but words could not leave his throat – only unintelligible gurgling. Moments later, Allard's eyes turned glassy.\n“Of course, the truth will never leave this room,” continued Lambert. “Military staff is being purged by general Duval’s soldiers,” he omitted the fact that those soldiers would be disposed of later, “and a proper state funeral will be conducted soon. In fact, we should plan it during the next meeting.”"

It seemed that the cult of Allard would take even larger proportions after his death, than it ever was during his life. His ‘successors’ were going to ensure that. The mausoleum of truly megalithic proportions, a behemoth of steel, marble, and concrete would tower over all of Aquila’s buildings, a silent monument to Le Patron. As Allard's coffin travelled through the streets, large crowds, standing on both sides of its path, wept and cried as it passed by. In some places, the police and the military struggled to maintain the line, pushed by the constantly growing number of mourners. Only after the funeral, it would be revealed that, in fact, dozens of griffons were crushed in the crowd.\nAllard was to be displayed in the central chamber of the mausoleum, its vast halls dedicated to commemorating the glory of the Revolution and its numerous victories, filled with reliefs and sculptures of triumphant soldiers and workers. No king or emperor had a more resplendent tomb than Le Patron. Of course, his assassins were there, walking in the funeral procession, already planning their next moves. Now they were entrusted with the legacy of Allard, and would make good use of it. After all, Le Patron has said a lot during his life, so subtle rewriting of some of his words would be easy. He had already erased so much of the past, that a bit more changes to it could easily slip by unnoticed. The only one who could protest was Allard himself – and he was dead.

While it was decent enough when fighting Reiher’s bandits due to their inability to adapt to our ever-changing tactics, now, when we have to engage in proper warfare, it’s proving to be ineffective. With commanders’ egos clashing, lack of unified regulations, and large-scale organisation, our forces are little more than rabble. Everyone agrees that we need to end this and reform the Pomovarran Liberation Army. There are several proposals on how to do so.\nFirst one is to emulate the Reichsarmee, the largest army in the history of Griffonia. A large part of the continents’ armies is still under the influence of its doctrine, including most of our officers. Though this would be the easiest approach, it would turn our army into a more defence-minded force.\nA distinguished commander of guerilla forces, Morvan Renan, suggested instead we should utilise our unorthodox approach to warfare and establish a doctrine of highly mobile and aggressive formations, able to outmanoeuvre the enemy. Arguing that trying to fight other nations of Griffonia head-on would be borderline suicidal due to their numerical advantage.\nThe third approach would be to develop our current ‘doctrine’ into something more workable by taking its best part, autonomy of field commanders, while creating a unified high command and standardised regulations, making our army highly adaptable."

At first, he was not going to take this job. There are usually more than enough businessgriffs willing to get rid of their competitors or intelligence services ‘outsourcing’ the dirty work for much better pay. However, it seemed as if all of them suddenly decided to adopt the pony principles of friendship. There was no other decent job he could find, and he needed money quickly. All he had to do was to track and shoot one griffon. His employer provided him with information that the target would move to a certain hospital – but it was Antoine’s job to choose a good spot. And so, he determined that to get into hospital, the target had to traverse a street where they would be perfectly exposed. For an hour now, the assassin was waiting in the attic of an abandoned house. It took a quarter of an hour more before a small column of cars entered the street. All were filled with soldiers, indicating that the target was rightly paranoid... Soon Antoine noticed his prey in the middle car. He aimed carefully... and wavered for a moment. It was quite risky, with that many soldiers. They would surely look for him – and even if he got away, he did not trust his employer to play fair. In a job like his, one had to learn to assess the characters of others, as many opted to cut the loose ties, as it was called, making assassins disappear after they did their job. This ‘Morel’ looked just like one such a griffon.\nBut he really needed the money... However, he wondered how much the target would pay if he offered a reversal of the deal.

Without Camriz, a major rival faction within the liberation movement started to collapse into infighting and divide itself into smaller groups – making it easy to make deals with disgruntled members. They, too, would be dealt with in the future. For now, Morel just enjoyed the moment of triumph, trying to maintain a facade of reverie and sadness. Judging by the reactions of others, it worked. Finally, time came for the longest and most tedious part of the funeral: speeches by anygriff of importance that arrived. Some of them seemed sincere, others were surely just here to push their political agendas. Morel managed to secure himself the last spot.\n“My compatriots already said a lot about the numerous virtues and heroic deeds of our fallen comrade. There is little to add, and we all know that Camriz was a griffon of action. We never were friends, we argued a lot, but I always respected him for his undaunting dedication to the cause of Pomovarran freedom. We might never know who killed him...” Hopefully, the bomb planted in the suitcase with money killed the hitman, so the secret was safe. “...but whoever did this hoped to weaken and divide us. We will all carry the dreams and hopes of our fallen brother – and many more who perished during this war – the dream of a free, united, and strong Pomovarra. Harmann Camriz might have died...”"

goy_pomovarra.48.d:0 "To say that Harmann Camriz was baffled would be a huge understatement. For a long time, he just sat there in disbelief of what the griffon that requested a meeting with him was saying. It is not every day that a griff enters your office, admits that he was paid to kill you, and that the one who paid him is your political rival. Morel might have been a demagogue, an idiot, and an Aquileian, but this seemed below even him. However, it made some twisted sense. There was something fishy about the whole attack on his soldiers in an area that was supposed to be clear of ‘princely deserters’. And from the details the assassin shared with him, it was obvious that he could have him killed without any problems.\n“So,” after a few minutes of uncomfortable silence, Harmann finally muttered, “I guess you are not here because of a sudden change of heart. Tell me... Why?”\n“Because I sincerely do not believe that I will be paid. And I really need this money. And I don’t want this country to fall into the hands of griffs like him, of course,” Antoine replied without any hesitation, “Pay me double – in advance, of course – and I will deal with, what’s his name, Morel?”\n“Where are decency and honour these days...” Harmann sighed, “Fine, we have a deal. But if you run away with the money, remember that here, in Pomovarra, we do not forget and do not forgive those who wrong us.”\n“Of course,” Antoine smiled slightly, “I’m a professional, not an idiot.”\nWhen the assassin left, Camriz poured himself a glass of vodka. This clearly was not a day he could make through sober. For a moment he pondered, whether the hitman would keep his word after betraying his previous employer? And how did it end like this: not with a fair fight, but through the use of dirty tricks? He turned Morel’s betrayal against him, but does it make the crime any lesser? He did many horrible things during the liberation war, but never did Camriz betray his brothers-in-arms. Even as much as he despised Morel, this was not the right way to end this..."

A week later, during a rally, when Morel started yet another of his fierce speeches, he was shot before the eyes of hundreds of gathered griffons. In the following chaos, the hitman managed to escape undetected while the gathered griffons were trampling each other in a bout of panic. The sudden death of Morel put his faction into complete disarray, and made it disintegrate almost overnight. With no other influential enough figure to rival him, it was obviously up to Harmann Camriz to step up and take the reins of the government.\nOf course, there were suspicions. Not everygriff believed the hasty explanation that Morel was killed on orders of communists he was known to despise with all his heart. However, more than enough griffons decided to follow Camriz anyway, even if they had their doubts. After all, he was a hero of the rebellion, and with Morel dead, no one else could command the loyalty of Pomovarrans."

Realms forged by the kings of old last through generations, even when their dynasties have long died out. Does the death of a single griffon invalidate everything they did? Of course not. It is up to their descendants to carry the idea, the dream, to keep it alive. And so we did. Some say that the Old Kingdom died during the Day of the Flaming Sky. It’s nothing more than an Aquileian lie! They knew that Pomovarran spirit was not broken, and they feared the day when our unstoppable tide would erase Aquileia! So, in fear, they tried to destroy the memory, knowing that while it lives, Pomovarrans will never be broken! They failed! Our glorious legacy lives on! Our kings might be gone, but their kingdom lives, a spiritual kingdom, within every one of us! A kingdom greater than any other, shared by all Pomovarrans, one which will only continue to rise and grow. There are many challenges ahead, brothers and sisters – but I promise to you that we will prevail! We shall triumph! And through our unshakable conviction we shall achieve the greatness we deserve. Every one of us must give all they can, as I will do. As the Regent of Pomovarra I shall lead us towards a bright future, towards a new age, an age of war and glory! The Little Maar of Flowena fell, and now we must finish our work and slay the Great Maar of Aquileia!”\nMorel’s followers cheered and clapped like madgriffs. Morel looked around the frenzied crowd. Some looked a bit confused by the proclamation of the new ‘kingdom’, but he knew that they will follow the crowd anyway. They had no choice, as they had no agency in these fateful days.

Patricians and their lackeys were to be executed, their remaining riches would go to the Kingdom’s treasury, and their great estates – demolished. Remaining symbols of Aquileian and Imperial reign would soon follow in a great purge. Beneath all this rotten façade of greed and self-indulgence, there was still a healthy core. Lots of good griffons, Pomovarran griffons, still lived here. They would be the ones to inherit the purified city – a New Flowena.

Now however, this pride was broken: the Pomovarran army paraded through the streets, and symbols of the fallen southern realm were being triumphantly torn down. By the end of the day, Pomovarrans gathered on a huge plaza in front of the former royal palace – the place where victory celebrations were to conclude. Starting with a customary commemoration of the fallen brothers-in-arms, followed by decoration of particularly distinguished soldiers, with awards given out by the Regent himself, it would end with a speech by Morel.\n“Soldiers! Brothers and sisters!” the Regent started. Crowds went silent, looking at their leader, as if mesmerized. Few believed a day of such triumph would come – and yet, all that he had promised, really happened, “Today we are the light in the west, one that dispersed the darkness which dwelled in this city. Our enemies were shattered, our vengeance – realised. This deed will live forever in memory of coming generations. You have realised the dream of your forefathers. You took their mantle and proved worthy of it. You are now true heirs of their legacy. I salute you, warriors of Pomovarra!” The Crowd of soldiers started to cheer. When they calmed down, Morel continued, “We have proven ourselves worthy heirs to the Kingdom of Old, to the legacy of the past! But there is yet one wrong that needs righting, one wound inflicted upon us by Aquileians centuries ago! When they defeated our ancestors, they extinguished the line of our kings, they slaughtered the best among Pomovarrans, its knights and protectors. And now it is only right to heal the last wound to our nation’s spirit. Today, I shall claim the mantle of the kings of old, the mantle of Madoc and Hoel. Henceforth, I will lead Pomovarra not as a Regent, but as its King. Warriors of the Boar, Protectors of Pomovarra, do you accept my claim?”\n“Lead us!

We are all just pawns in a greater battle of wills, a struggle of fates, and a clash of nations. And while a single pawn can make a difference in battle, what battle they end up in is beyond their own choice. Aquileians are cursed to participate in this eternal conflict against Pomovarrans. Their cause is faulty, but punishing them all for it would be punishing them for doing the right thing: following the spirit of their nation. I do not hate Aquileians, I hate the spirit of Aquileia, the wicked spirit of the nation I rejected. Thus, it became my mission to eradicate it, to break the wheels on the carriage of their destiny and stop its ride. I must prove that there is nothing truly unique, truly great in Aquileian destiny. If Aquileian destiny would prevail, they would remake Griffonia in their image... But what are they? A pale spectre, imitating the legacy of Karthinia and legacy of Grovers – whom they envy. As in their heart, an Aquileian is an envious creature first and foremost. That’s why I envied Pomovarra – until understood this. That was when swore to do all I could to destroy the Aquileian in me.

Well, the execution squad was quite busy these days. While all across former Aquileia monuments were being demolished, works of culture given to the flames, and griffons deemed dangerous executed (thank gods for detailed information left by the Aquileian bureaucracy that made finding these individuals easy), Morel decided to oversee the destruction of this university personally. He knew that it was the true heart of Aquila. Not its palaces, not its temples, not its lavish residences. Those were all just trinkets. A nation can exist without a country, a faith can exist without temples, but without knowledge of the past, without memories – nothing can persist. A group of trusted griffons meticulously analysed contents of the university’s library, selecting works potentially useful for research efforts to be carried away for later translation – and destruction of original Aquileian texts, with all traces of original authorship erased.\nAll that was left was to transport the few last crates of useful books and burn down what remained. While passing a pile of loose papers, Morel noticed a small tome. He picked it up from the floor and flipped through the pages. Poetry. Quite decent, actually. For a moment he felt an urge to keep the book. He recalled a story of an ancient ruler from a far-away land, somewhere in Zebrica. When said ruler tried to erase everything he deemed dangerous to his state, he kept one copy of each destroyed book for his own use.\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Morel threw the book back into the pile. Doing as that zebra did would suggest that there was something valuable in what was destroyed – undermining the whole effort. Aquileia had to be erased, its culture – marginalised, all its symbols – destroyed. Of course, in modern times it would be nearly impossible. But it was an act of creating a historical narrative, a legend. A story of a nation so weak and despicable that nothing of its legacy was deemed worthy to live on.

While all symbols of the Grovers’ dynasty were removed, most of the city avoided the wrath which consumed its western peers. Griffenheim was to be preserved for the culmination of the years of wars and suffering – for the greatest triumph of Pomovarra.

That alluring belief in establishing eternal empires, every great conqueror has espoused, is foolish. It is only natural and good that the only path to growth lies through adversity. Thus, a world dominated by a single, eternal state would be one of degeneration. And so, as every ruler dies, it matters not how many armies they vanquished, or how much territory they conquered. What matters is how they are remembered. Griffonia saw many conquerors, yet few remain in our minds today. They are those who conquered not only land, but also souls of griffons, ones who left a mark on griffon history. Griffons still remember Arantigos, the first great conqueror, though what he accomplished turned into dust long ago. Southern griffons are a mere pale imitation of ancient Sparleos, temples and fortresses of its age have long become piles of rubble, but the spirit of Arantigos lives on. Throughout centuries, many emulated him, and even if the last trace of his people were to be erased, memories of him would remain. Griffons will always read stories about his accomplishments, his conquests – and will be captivated.\nTherefore, my goal was obvious; to make sure that the memory of Pomovarra became so deeply engraved in the collective memory of Griffonkind that it could never be forgotten. Every griffon would carry a piece of Pomovarran history in him, and even if by some cruel twist of fate, my Pomovarra fell, someone would inevitably reclaim its legacy. This is true immortality of an idea. You can kill every single griff of a nation, but if memory of its greatness lives, inevitably, it will be reborn.”"

All across Bronzehill, dogs have started an open revolt against us. While they are disorganised and poorly armed, they are also numerous and know the terrain well. In a way, their dedication and fervour are admirable, but they cannot stand in the way of our destiny. Multiple military units have been moved into the Bronzehill mountains, and we are conducting a sweeping operation against diamond dog guerillas and their suspected assistants. The losses are staggering, yet we are inflicting much higher damage to the rebels – and within a few months we expect to deal with all resistance.\nHowever, a major side effect is nearly complete destruction of the region's industrial potential. Due to combat-inflicted devastation and sabotage done by the rebels, and with most local diamond dogs either dying in combat or fleeing, we do not expect Bronzehill to be of much use when we are finished with putting down this revolt."

It is simply inevitable, and any reign over distant, foreign lands will draw such creatures as collaborateurs. Now I have to deal with them, as they try to weasel their way into my grace. But there is a purpose to them. Greatness can be perceived only in contrast to misery, and is there a better way to propagate misery in a nation than let it be ruled by degenerates? So, I will let them rule – become governors of the distant provinces which otherwise would inevitably try to topple the established power. I will let them pester and infect the periphery of the realm. And knowing that their power is dependent only on their overlord, they will do their best to please the rulers of Pomovarra, while commoners will hate them, instead of me and my descendants.

Through this, we grow, through this we become stronger. Inevitably, every great realm falls apart, and its successor-states fight for dominance. Few are remembered, those who achieved something deemed impossible for those who came before them. How different is Pomovarra from the empire of Grovers? After all, they already achieved what seemed impossible, unifying Griffonkind under one government. Will conquering a bit more land let us surpass this achievement? No, I would always be compared to Grover the Great. Returning a nation from the brink of defeat is enough of a feat for a conqueror, but believing that conquest of land is what shapes the future is foolishness. It is the conquest of minds, conquest of souls that matters. My legacy will be that of strife and chaos. When others tried to unify conquered lands, they only nurtured their future rivals. By trying to forge everlasting empires, they only condemned them to a slow, ignoble death. Such is the eternal cycle. Even now I see cracks in the structure I built. An unsustainable system, meant to fall. And yet, it will fall when Pomovarran spirit is still untainted by opulence of long peace, when Pomovarra is still vibrant and not weakened by ages of slowly withering hegemony. Thus, I sow the seeds of future triumphs. I leave Pomovarra strong and ready, and its rivals weak and divided. My successors will have to be warriors and visionaries, not mere administrators. They will face conflicts and lead Pomovarra to emerge victorious. And if they won’t, then they will have proven themselves unworthy of the legacy I left to them, unworthy of the Pomovarran spirit. But the history of Pomovarra will only expand – and it will always rise from the ashes. Such is my dream. Such is my legacy.”\nMorel closed the book. It was finally complete. Left among his personal belongings it would wait for its time. For the moment in the future when it would be discovered, and shed light on his actions. An act of vanity to explain himself to future generations. So they could understand. And if were lost... Well, they would surely make something up. The one thing he regretted was not knowing how history would judge him. Would future generations see him as a tyrant and oppressor? What reasons will they believe he had? The thrill of the unknown which future brings always enamoured him. Yet for now there was still much to be done for Pomovarra to retain its place. And yet, deep inside of him there was this feeling of unease. As if he had forgotten about something...\n\nMany years later, in a small town south of Rila, a rally was held, in a show of complete impunity. Hundreds of griffons, many of which carried flags with the Aquileian lily blended with armed resistance fighters on the town square."

goy_pomovarra.67.d:0 "Renan took a deep breath before entering his superior’s study. A cloud of cigarette smoke seemed to accompany Camriz everywhere he came, but here it was thick like fog over Vedinian fjords. For a non-smoker staying here was almost torture – one which Renan had to endure daily in recent times. He was ordered to screen the nascent Pomovarran officer corps for ‘subversive activities’ – specifically for Morel supporters keen on making trouble. Most of his movements disintegrated into stillborn political parties, fighting each other over the purity of their weird doctrines they inherited from their deceased leader. However, a few of the former ‘Boar Warriors’ – as they once called themselves – were gathering support in the army, calling the current Pomovarran leadership ‘unworthy and soft’. And so, the screening came about – with demotions, retirements, and military tribunals removing these unsavory elements from the army. Today, Renan was bringing another list of dissidents to be discharged for Camriz to sign. The commander took a brief glance at the paper and produced a pen from his pocket.\n“I think these are the last of them,” said Renan, “the rest of the former Warriors are not associated with subversive groups, and in my opinion could be left undisturbed.”\n“Mhm,” murmured Camriz. “They are good soldiers. Pity that so many of them bought into this crap Morel screamed at his rallies. ‘Boar-Warriors’! He really went wild when choosing the name for his movement!” The commander chuckled. Seeing confusion on his subordinate’s face, he then asked, “Haven’t you heard this story? Old Morel read too much of the ancient legends and chose the most grandiose name he found – probably the most obscure, too. Before meeting Morel, most partisan leaders thought the Warriors to be some sort of peasant militia...” Camriz signed the document and gave it back to the other officer. When Renan left, he leaned back in his chair, lost in thoughts.\nThe Boar-Warrior... Camriz always wondered how his old adversary found out about him. He came from a tale only told among clans most fervently protecting the old ways. Harmann himself heard it from his grandmother who loved to bore him with long stories. A tale of an ancient king, or maybe a chief (he did not really remember), who was offered gifts of strength and power from Arcturius himself in recognition of his bravery. He laughed in the god’s face and said he needed none of it, as he would dishonour himself and his clan by wielding the power which was not his own – and that Arcturius clearly did not understand the true meaning of honour and glory. If he somehow found his powers lacking, he said, he always had his clansgriffs by his side. The angered god cursed the king, turning him into a boar-like monster, filled with rage. And yet, such was the resolve of the Boar-Warrior, that he managed to control this rage, turning it only against the enemies of his clan, defeating all the foes they had, and any beast or monster they faced, making his clan the greatest among all in Pomovarra. When many years later, Arcturius, awed by his accomplishments, offered to lift the curse, the king laughed in the god's face yet again – and was smitten by Arcturius in his wrath. But what were his last words which angered the god... Camriz could not recall this part of the tale. He took a long drag on the cigarette – and then he remembered,"

goy_pomovarra.68.d:0 "Flowena, the City of Gardens. Camriz has visited the city a few times before – with every visit’s matter being more pressing. From meetings with weapon smugglers, it changed to making contacts with local Pomovarran sympathizers, and then to extracting information from his spies. And while he always enjoyed a certain degree of anonymity around these parts, the danger of being caught was still present. Never were the circumstances good to appraise local architecture or ponder Flowenan history. And now that he came here not as a sneaking rebel, but as the city’s new master, the time still wasn’t right. There were many problems to deal with. Most of the important patricians had fled the city, afraid of being lynched by either Pomovarran soldiers or disgruntled commoners. Apparently, not only Pomovarrans despised the opulent merchant-princes of Flowena – so did a large part of their own subjects. The city itself now existed in a weird equilibrium: while the Pomovarran army technically controlled it, most of the affairs were handled by a hastily assembled council of local guilds’ representatives and various ‘respected members of the community’. What Camriz saw as esepcially intriguing was that all griffs on the council were of Aquileian, Herzlandish, or Pomovarran origins... yet most of them rather preferred calling themselves ‘Flowenans’.\nWhile a large portion of the Flowenan lower class was composed of Pomovarran migrants, the city was always a melting pot. When traversing the streets, Camriz saw a city both strange and familiar. Thus, the sudden power vacuum created by the fall of the patricians, caused a shift in the mentality of the locals – unifying them around the identity they all shared; Flowenan citizens. What was worse, they had demands! Petitions and delegations asking for autonomy for the city were arriving at Camriz’ office almost daily. Simultaneously he had to deal with radicals in his army that called for him to ‘purge Flowena of non-Pomovarrans’... But how could one ‘purge’ a city of griffons whose identity was so muddled? The solution could not be delayed any longer, as both sides grew more impatient with every passing day. Camriz could dissolve the council and set up Pomovarran government in the city, or accept the demands and leave the locals on their own... But then, what was the point of the war, if Flowenans would stay in charge of the city?"

Do we need a lecture on the value of friendship?”\n“Severyanans.”\n“What?” the officer’s tone changed to one of surprise.\n“They are Severyanans, not Equestrians. They are a different bunch of ponies, more into fighting than talking. Anyway, they are our best chance. Aquileia outgriffs and outguns us, and we need any advantage we can get to win this war. These ponies will help us in providing countermeasures for whatever Aquileian mages will throw at us.” Camriz tapped on the desk with his claw. “We do not need another Day of the Flaming Skies. We will not survive another such disaster as a nation.”\n“So, we fight fire with fire... Or rather ponies with ponies?”\n“Correct!” Camriz smiled faintly. “Only a fool does not learn from his mistakes. And we need every advantage we can get. So, yes, we will hire these mages. Like Aquileians did centuries ago. You know, ponies did not appear there – like you said – to give lectures on friendship. They came as warriors, as mercenaries. Aquileians had fought with us for like... two hundred years? Three hundred? Something like this – and then they ended the war in one day! All these great knights, famed generals and nobles – fried by pony magic! There is a lesson to be learned from this disaster, it is only pity that we started learning so late.”\n“And what is that lesson, Commander?”"

Why do you even bother me with this crap?” Hearing this, a visibly troubled clerk started stammering a response, but got cut off by the commander hitting the desk with his fist, “Do not waste my time, dammit! Why is this even my problem? Local officials should deal with it.”\n“The claimant is from clan Tallec, and the official responsible for the area is from the Cariou family... They’ve hated each other for centuries... When Arzhou Cariou rejected the claim, Tallecs called Carious a bunch of thieves and traitors... And arrived to Cariou’s office with guns. They occupied the hall, and are refusing to leave until we bring the issue to you, sir...” The clerk added quietly, “we have no idea what to do...”\n“This again... Just for a moment we stop fighting outsiders – and we’re instantly tearing ourselves apart.” Camriz sighed and pulled out another cigarette from the pack. “I know a Tallec clan elder, he is as stubborn as a goat – and twice as unpleasant – but he had always supported the cause... And now this. Tell him that Arzhou Carriou makes judgments in my name, and offending his impartiality is an offense to my honour. It should settle the matter for now, until they find some other stupid issue to argue about. Just remember to relay these exact words!”\nWhen the clerk left, Camriz started massaging his temples. This was getting ridiculous. But he remembered it too well. Over twenty years ago, during the previous uprising, it was all the same. The clans bickered and fought each other for the pettiest of reasons. Someone’s grandfather stole another one’s sheep, someone’s ancestor offended the founder of another clan... They spent more time arguing than planning defences. And then Reiher just swept them away with little resistance. It seemed that only a common enemy could unite Pomovarrans... And now it was the same. First Morel and his bunch of morons, now the clans... It’s as if conflict was in Pomovarran nature. And it was up to him to try to govern this madhouse. At this point he was almost ready to surrender to Aquileians and ask to be executed. Maybe in afterlife he could rest. Or maybe not, if what grandma’s tales were true, there he would meet all his ancestors – probably fighting each other there as well. Camriz chuckled, imagining Boreas having to deal with countless generations of Pomovarrans. Even the god of justice is probably fed up with them at this point and is considering sending them all to Maar. Nevertheless, something had to be done. Finding a new enemy would not be very difficult – Aquileians were still there across the border. All he had to do was to remind the clans about all they did to their ancestors. The alternative was a tedious job of mediating, trying to convince clan elders to forgive past transgressions, leveraging his personal authority. A terrifying prospect..."

All I need in my officer staff is more politics – just after I managed to get rid of Morel’s idiots – now it’s you... At least tell me you’re not some socialist. Because if you are, then I am apparently even worse at choosing associates than I thought.”\n“Of course not! It’s just a normal, republican party...”\n“Pangriffonians then? A weird choice for a Pomovarran partisan, I must say.” It seemed that Camriz has transitioned from anger to amusement at this point.\n“Well, Commander... Republican tenets are not all about pangriffonism. The three core principles are liberty, prosperity, and democracy. Decent values for Pomovarra, if we are to move to a less... provisional type of government. And this is not a bad way to guide a nation into the future.” The younger officer looked bewildered, but managed to keep composure during his explanation. “Of course, we support your leadership, commander, but...”\n“Bah!” Camriz waved his claw. “I have zero interest in politics. It disgusts and bores me. When we are done with the war, I will retire from my position, and then you and your new friends can implement whatever ideology you preach. You can assure them; I do not plan to become a permanent provisional leader. I’m fine with playing this role, until Pomovarra is free – then I’ll step down. Just do not bring up politics during staff meetings, and you can continue your little hobby.”\n“Thank you, Commander!” Renan smiled widely.\nA few minutes after the conversation was over, the commander murmured to himself, as doors closed behind the leaving officer,\n“I wonder what’s next, he’ll start quoting Kemerskai?” Camriz sighed and leaned back in his chair. Republicanism... He never actually gave much of a thought to politics, being preoccupied with throwing grenades, Angriverian cocktails, and other exploding things into Aquileian soldiers during the Republican Revolution. And then Aquileians had their own revolution. And out of it, they still came out as the same insufferable bunch of griffs who tried to stomp every other nation in the West. Yet, from all these revolts came an opportunity. Without them, without the collapse of the old powers, Pomovarra would continue to wane and would eventually die. Now it had a chance. But would it be a nation he dreamed of? Or something new, something else... How would this new state be any different from one griffons like Kemerskai and Verany envisioned?"

However, things did not look good: it was obvious that the coming war with Aquileia would be an uphill battle. No way to sugarcoat it; this would be like trying to slay a bear with a wooden sword. For a large part of the general staff meeting, the commander stayed quiet, listening to all of the reports, before finally speaking up.\n“We need allies,” said Camriz, lighting yet another cigarette, “even if we somehow win, we cannot hold this place all by ourselves. And winning on our own is borderline impossible. Luckily, we’re not the only ones who hate Aquileians.”\n“What do you mean?” asked Morvan Renan, as always shadowing the Commander.\n“Feathisians. Like us, they struggle against a much powerful foe. We have Aquileians, they have Herzlanders. And we still have some friends there, in the north, after all the lots of weapons we’ve smuggled here from Adelart. We will send envoys there, make some amends...”\n“This is rightful Pomovarran territory!” One of the younger officers objected.\n“Rightful territory... Borders change, but what makes us Pomovarrans is our blood, our shared legacy – not some land claims. We can work this out, we will get much more in the south.” Camriz smiled faintly. “When the prey is large enough, it can feed a whole pack. And it is better to share our prize than to die alone.

Looted during the battle, it was considered of little use by Pomovarrans, and aside from a few soldiers guarding its abandoned halls, the once-opulent building was almost deserted. In the last few weeks however, the palace was hastily cleaned up and damage to it was repaired. Reasons for this would be unveiled soon, as delegates of various partisan groups, clan elders, and aspiring politicians from all over Pomovarra gathered in it. Of course, such diversity would cause certain frictions. The largest point of contention was the presence of, as some put it, ‘traitorous foreigners’: Flowenians, Aquileans from the borderlands, and even a lone Adelartian. From the perspective of Camriz, this was almost like hell; he dreaded having to deal with such a mass of politicians. But he had to endure it. He put lots of effort to organise this meeting – and get all of these griffons into one building without them killing each other.\n“Comrades, friends,” he started speaking, “you might wonder why I invited all of you here. It is a rather difficult time for Pomovarra, and I should be planning military campaigns, rather than hosting idle political meetings – and that’s exactly the problem. I realised recently, that all we have lived for is conflict. There is nothing else than war in Pomovarra, it is the only thing that unites us. I spent my entire life fighting, and to be honest, I’m tired of it. I postponed all the planning for the future ‘until we are done with war’. And you followed. No-one really questioned my leadership, despite its legitimacy coming solely from the barrel of a rifle. But what then? When we’ve vanquished our foreign enemies? I realised that I have no answer. And that’s why we need to start thinking about the future now. And not only the future of Pomovarra, but of all of us. That’s why I invited representatives from the city of Flowena, and those from our neighbouring nations that were willing to listen. We cannot undo the past, but we must leave it behind to be able to move forward – together. Otherwise, there will never be an end to this war. When we’re done fighting outsiders, we’ll start fighting among ourselves. And I will have to remain in command for much longer than I and you are willing to endure.” Some of the gathered griffons laughed at his joke. “We have much to discuss, so...

With this in mind, the general staff have approved the suggestion of major Hendrik Grijsbek to provide Pomovarra with limited military support in the form of a cadre of skilled officers and some surplus equipment to give them a better fighting chance. After all, we stand almost nothing to lose from such a small investment, while having much to gain."

Every time when opportunity arose, every few decades, Pomovarrans revolted against their oppressors – and each time their uprisings were, in the end, quelled. Those who led Pomovarrans into doomed rebellions were the best of us, ones who remembered the past – and dreamed of a better future. And every time, after each defeat, a new wave of repressions followed. Noble houses were destroyed, clan leaders perished in battles, stewards of our legacy were murdered. And yet, it never stopped us. However, every time we lost something – and left was only the dream of freedom. Now, when we have finally reclaimed it, we can fully understand the extent of the damage dealt to our nation. Our ancient way of life is almost forgotten, our language has been supplanted by one of our conquerors, our history and legends are remembered only by a few old griffons.\nAction must be taken, if we want to save what little we have left. A committee of linguists has codified Modern Pomovarran language to be introduced as the official language of our state, and the only one to be legally used by our administration, replacing Aquileian – a painful reminder of our past of subservience. Scholars have already started researching scattered remnants of surviving historical texts in libraries of the most venerable clans and conducting interviews with wandering storytellers, while also trying to procure or at least gain permission to study surviving relics from the Pomovarran past owned by cultural institutions in other nations. When ready, comprehensive books about our history and collections of legends and myths will become part of every schoolgriff’s curriculum, in order to instil a feeling of national pride and connection with the past within our nation's future generations."

goy_pomovarra.84.d:0 "The former royal palace in Aquila was quiet – almost unnaturally quiet. While the building was spared from destruction during the battle for the city, in the following tumultuous days many of its riches ended up stolen. The building itself lost its purpose, and with most of the staff dismissed, only a few Pomovarran guards patrolled its empty halls. Morvan Renan walked through the palace, soon getting lost in the maze of its corridors. The griffon he was looking for was nowhere to be found, but according to the guards he had to be somewhere in this building.\nFinally, Renan picked up a faint smell of tobacco smoke which inevitably led him to Camriz in what once was an art gallery. Paintings were one of the few things thieves ignored, instead taking their gilded frames. Commander stood in front of a huge painting, doing what he always did – smoking. For a moment, the two griffons stood in silence, until Renan asked,\n“Commander, have you checked the plans for the victory parade I had sent? The council wants it organised within a week.”\n“Yes, sure. Do it that way,” responded Camriz absent-mindedly, intently staring at the painting. What followed was another moment of awkward silence. “The Day of the Flaming Skies,” said Camriz – half to himself, half to Renan. “This depiction is horrible. Knights’re wearing armours which would only be made two hundred years after the battle happened, and it was not on a plain, but among hills. Though, I guess, afterwards they did become flat... Also, there was no Pomovarran royal left to formally surrender the shards of Direndall, as they were all dead...” Camriz pointed to a specific scene in the painting.\n“That’s... interesting, Commander. I didn’t know you had an interest in historical art,” Renan answered, baffled by this sudden tirade.\n“Long ago, I wanted to study history... But then Griffonia went crazy. I wonder, had this war happened a few centuries ago, would there be a similar painting of the moment when what was left of the Aquileian government surrendered to us? And how would it look? Tell me, Renan, what do you think the artist wanted to show here?”\nMorvan shifted from paw to paw, surprised by the question, “I guess, triumph? The glory of Aquileia?”\n“And we remember this day as one of terror and carnage. For seven hundred years we tried to avenge it. And now we’re here. Aquileians will probably remember this moment in the same way.” Camriz took a drag on the cigarette. “Morel was a moron, but of all his ramblings one made sense. The cycles. History repeating itself with different actors. Let’s go, Renan, there are parade plans to review, right?”\nCamriz started walking away, but the other officer stood still, pondering something.\n“Commander, if you believe that history repeats itself, then what will happen next? What will be the future of Pomovarra?” Hearing this, Camriz stopped.\n“Next...” he said after a brief moment of reflection, “we will rule Aquileians, and they will hate us for it. This was supposed to be their age. The previous one had to end with their triumph, but instead it was a sad whimper. As for us... we will do our best to keep Pomovarra strong and will make many mistakes in the process. But one thing is certain. At least, now..."

Metropolises of great wealth and power, centres of commerce and industry, dominating the entire region, free cities are now under our control, and have become our personal headache. Inhabited by many, truly many griffons of diverse and often... muddled national identity, they nevertheless are a vital part of the Pomovarran Republic due to their strategic importance. We must, however, decide on how to most efficiently – and preferably – peacefully govern local griffons. Fezera is unlikely to cause issues here, due to nearly complete erosion of its old power structures, undermined by their oligarchy and rampant crime. Considering the relative cultural similarity of Fezerans to Greifwaldians, they can be easily integrated with Pomovarra as kinfolk – and will welcome actual law and order in their city with relief.\nLands of Skyfall are what causes most of the problems. The region’s population can be charitably described as vaguely Feathisian, though this does not apply to the melting pot which the city of Skyfall has always been. Its vast population of Herzlandish griffons, Greifwaldians in the south, and numerous specimens of every imaginable species and nationality call Skyfall their home – the same had done famous Skyfallian oligarchs, before their assets got nationalised by us. We couldn’t risk another Flowena rising within our territory. Yet, we need to decide what to do with Skyfall proper. The simplest option would be to just grant Skyfall unique status within Pomovarra as a semi-autonomous province with limited self-governance and certain kinfolk privileges granted to its residents. A more radical option would be to declare all Skyfallians our kinfolk, except for the most... unusual and colourful cases. However, that could cause certain destabilisation within our carefully balanced republic. We could also go the middle way, declaring the free cities as autonomous regions within Pomovarra, while integrating their outlying regions, which would let us focus more on assimilation of said areas."

The ever-unruly Pomovarrans launched an uprising, and even after being crushed by warlord Leopold Reiher, continued their struggle covertly. Then, after toppling their self-proclaimed prince, Pomovarrans declared independence again, promptly conquering the city of Flowena, home of their long-time oppressors. Now, Pomovarrans lead the so-called ‘Aetian League’, uniting La Peripherie under a single banner. The obvious goal of the League is containing us.\n\nHowever, recently we received a diplomatic note from ‘Commander’ Harmann Camriz, the League’s leader, who declared his willingness to negotiate an agreement between the League and our Republic to end hostilities and peacefully reorganise and reunite the region, with Aquileia and her former subjects coexisting as equals. The offer was met with disbelief among most, with Pomovarrans known for their rabid hatred of us. Members of the MPA and many other politicians demand to refuse this offer and prepare for an imminent war with the League, claiming that negotiating with the ‘rebellious provinces’ would be tantamount to treason against the Aquileian cause. However, some less nationalistic figures view this as a chance at a new beginning for the region. A possibility of establishing lasting peace and making amends with our neighbours..."

The pony valet standing by the doors put on a disgusted face, saying in an uptight tone, “You can’t smoke in the conference room, there are no ashtrays here,” and reacted with an angry snort to Camriz suggesting he bring one. The Commander was not going to leave for the balcony every time he wanted to smoke. Renan paid a knowing, pained look to the pony, but did not say a word. “Could this be a trap...” Camriz wondered out loud.\n“It would be the weirdest trap, Commander,” replied Renan. “They could have arrested us all back when we crossed the border, or when we arrived at Westkeep.” At this moment the doors finally opened, and a small group of Aquileian officials led by a middle-aged griffoness entered the room.\n“I think I recognise the officer on the right,” Camriz whispered, “I threw a grenade at his car back in 980, but sadly I missed.”\n“Gentlegriffs,” the grifoness spoke up, “it’s my pleasure to welcome you to Westkeep. Excuse me for the wait; there were some... safety issues on the way. I’m Cecille Gaudreau, President of the Aquileian Republic.” Cecille extended a claw towards Camriz, which he accepted and shook firmly.\n“Ah, the safety issues...” Camriz chuckled. “I had those myself on the way here; some rascals put a bomb under my car, but luckily, they failed to wire it right.”\n“Apparently, we face similar problems. Both here and in Pomovarra there are griffons unhappy with this turn of events. But, since we’re all here, safe and sound, let’s begin! There is much to discuss...”\nNegotiations took up the whole day. Despite several points left hanging, a general agreement was achieved. Finer details would have to be specified later, but the main document was signed, formalising the treaty. The Pomovarran delegation stayed for a small celebration the next day despite Camriz’ aversion, (he found official parties scarier than an advancing tank division). Luckily, this time ashtrays were provided, and he spent most of the party in his element, discussing matters of partisan warfare with several Aquileian officers, exchanging experiences they had during both revolutions – Aquileian and Pomovarran ones."

There was so little left between the redacted sections that it read like incoherent babble. He truly hated preparing speeches, and wondered how the heck Morel managed to speak for hours, seemingly without any preparations. With a loud sigh, he took yet another blank sheet. Unity, future, forgiveness... He knew what he wanted to speak about, but somehow could not make it into a coherent whole. After a few minutes of scribbling, he dropped the pen, lit a cigarette, and turned to the wall, blankly staring at it. After all the fighting, three decades of struggle, he’d done it. He achieved peace. A lasting peace, hopefully, leading to a better future. He’d been tired of war for a while now, and yet he never made plans for what to do when it ended. Now, he was writing a speech about tolerance, about forgiveness; he understood that Aquileians hoped for it too, at least some of them... And yet he could not forget about the years he spent fighting them, about all his friends, fellow soldiers and family members who died at war with them. The Pomovarran way called for vengeance, for paying blood for blood. He chose to forsake it, the legacy of his ancestors. Without it, who was he – and what was Pomovarra? While walking the streets of Pomazhon recently, he heard even less of the language of his ancestors than during Reiher’s reign. Without war, Pomovarrans seemed to just melt into all the larger groups around them. He was the one to put an end to war. Would he become the one who brought an end to Pomovarra?\nThere was commotion in the corridor, and soon someone knocked loudly on the door. Then, Morvan Renan, flanked by a few other officers, barged into the room. They were a colourful bunch, dressed in clothes of all militaries soon to be merged into the new Aetian Army, which still did not have enough uniforms.\n“Commander, sorry to interrupt you, but we have certain suggestions about the planned parade, and we need your consultation.” Camriz only managed a weak nod. Griffs started shouting over each other, suggesting new ideas, criticising and adjusting them. Camriz contributed minimally to the discourse, and at some point, the group seemingly forgot about his existence. Soon, from this sudden brainstorm, a plan was hatched, a rather well-devised one at that. When the officers left, a realisation came over Camriz. His mission was simply... finished. He had nothing more to add; Aetia could continue on its own – griffons like Renan would make sure of that. He also realised another thing. Even if he did not hear Pomovarran on the streets as often as before, griffons he saw looked happy. Perhaps this was the true legacy of his nation – to bring peace to Griffonia, and guide it into a better future. Even if they would not be a part of it. A worthy legacy."

And besides that, there are some good griffons left – like you. Not to mention that I’m a bit... divisive among some within the Aquileian part of our new army. Also, not to mention that some politicians are already complaining about ‘unlimited military presence in politics’ – and if I stayed, they would without doubt try to leverage my influence to further their goals... And I’m done with politics. As long as I stay with the army, I cannot ever be free from this. By the way, congratulations on your nomination. I always knew you would strive high – but going for the presidency? You are one ambitious bird.”\n“Thank you, Commander.” Morvan tipped his head. “I will make sure to keep your legacy alive...”\nCamriz laughed. “Meaning, you’re going to start smoking? I’m surprised it turned out so well in the end, but try to find your own path, Renan. You are a smart griffon, so do not repeat my mistakes – so many mistakes. And do not call me ‘Commander’ anymore, I’m no longer in charge here.”\n“So... what are you going to do now, Commander?” asked Renan.\n“What did I just tell you about the ‘Commander’ thing...” Camriz sighed. “Well, you probably don’t know this, but I always wanted to study history. I think I’ll get back into it. There is a lot of oral tradition to write down, before it is forgotten lost... Or maybe I’ll finally visit Maregypt? You know, I always wanted to see its pyramids...” Renan’s face distorted, and he started making sounds like those of a tractor’s engine. “Don’t laugh, Renan, an old bird can have his dreams too!”\n“I just imagined you in one of these Caballan flowery shirts Equestrian tourists sometimes wear.

While the colonel could walk or fly, Schattenzahn could not. For now, he was lying on the back couch of the car, in a blissful unconsciousness caused by painkillers. That and a crude bandage was all Reiher could get to help his old friend, who had got shot in the belly. Colonel hoped they could find a doctor once they’d moved far enough away from Flowena – yet here they were, stuck in some godsforsaken forest. Once again, Reiher searched through the trunk, but there was not even a small canister of fuel in it. In a fit of anger, he kicked the back of the car. That achieved only one thing: awakened the wounded dog.\n“Where are we? Not in Flowena, right?” he whispered quietly.\n“No, we’re not. We left it a couple hours ago. I stopped to inflate a tire,” Reiher quickly came up with a convincing lie, carefully opening the passenger door to talk to his beat-up comrade.\n“Good... Good... Everything went south. And we’d been so close...”\n“So close...” repeated Reiher. “Damned be these Pomovarrans, Aquileians – or whatever these spawns of Maar are called. We were that close, Heinrich – that close to getting fabulously rich and leaving this place.”\n“It would be nice. But I took the bag with gold... The ‘just in case’ one...”\n“Good thinking.

They’ll probably come up with an entire series of jokes about us, don’t you think?” There came nothing but silence in response. Reiher knew all too well what had happened.\nThe Colonel went back to the trunk, reached for the unassuming briefcase and opened it. Inside there were several gold ingots – enough to spend the rest of one’s life in luxury. Reiher closed it, sighed, pulled out a spade and started digging a hole right by the car.

Skyfallians care for neither the past, nor the future, focused only on their pursuit of quick profits. Unlike in Flowena, there was no healthy core amidst all this corruption. Thus, our only choice was to cleanse the city in the way that a doctor does with infected wounds. A large portion of the population – hopefully including all the potential troublemakers – will be forced to leave, and the dirty slums skirting the ‘free cities’ will be demolished. Of course, many will resist – but we’ve had enough practice in dealing with such problems. All assets belonging to oligarchs and foreigners will be nationalised, and the riches they stole from common griffons will be put to better uses. While we have no interest in extravagances offered by Skyfall’s trade network, we can still utilise the city’s immense industrial potential – its shipyards and factories will churn out the tools for our subjugation of Griffonia.

goy_pomovarra.105.d:0 "Summary Report\nExamination of Direndall proved without any doubt that the sword was indeed forged by the dog smiths of Diamond Mountain about eight hundred years ago. Enchanted via both canine and griffon magic, the sword, aside from its legendary ability to cut through any material, also shielded its owner from enemy spells. This however proved insufficient to protect the King from unicorn spells which caused extensive damage to both the structure of the sword and its enchantments. Some of the blade’s properties have been irreversibly lost and are impossible to recreate, hindering our research. With assistance of several smiths from Angaz-Barak, our team has been able to replicate the enchantment responsible for providing the blade with its armour-piercing capabilities. While most effective when applied to magical weaponry, conventional infantry weapons can also, to some extent, be upgraded in this way. However, weapons with said enchantments will not be on par with Direndall due to the lack of specialised materials used to forge the sword, found only in Underbark in extremely limited quantities. Nevertheless, we managed to obtain enough of these materials to restore Direndall to its fully functional state with the help of Angaz-Barak’s smiths. The reforged blade will be delivered to the King, per his orders, to serve him as it has in ancient times."

goy_pomovarra.106.d:0 "Summary Report\nAnalysis of the provided data allowed us to recreate the ritual of spirit-binding in the way that mages from the 2nd century ALB described it. Studies of old magic tomes highly suggest that their authors have not succeeded in performing the ritual, instead relying on older works – which did not survive to the modern era. The relatively sparse presence of spirits in Western Griffonia caused some difficulties, yet we managed to secure enough such creatures to go through to the test phase. The first batch of griffon test subjects died during the binding process; the same happened with captured ponies. Further tests proved that involuntary binding process ends with death of the test subject in almost every instance, with rejection of the magical bond proceeding harmlessly in rare cases.\nThe second batch of test subjects – this time volunteers – led to a much greater success rate, with 52% of the bindings ending successfully, and only 3% ending with fatalities. We expect a higher success ratio in cases where magical components are cooperative. Successfully bound griffons displayed increased physical capabilities, and 5% of them gained magical aptitude – mostly of the elemental variety. The strength of these effects was directly proportional to the magical potential of the bound spirit. However, binding to stronger spirits corresponded with rapid deterioration of health – both physical and mental. Within three months all subjects that gained magical capabilities were either incapacitated or died. Observation of others will be continued, but they also displayed signs of deteriorating health, with a prognosis of one to five years of remaining lifespan and about half this time of capacity for military service.\nThe second research team, using collected data from the first, successfully bound spirits to inanimate objects. Infantry equipment – especially of the melee variety – and armoured vehicles proved to be the best vessels for spirits. For why this is the case, Doctor Duff suggested psychological reasons most usually displayed by personification of such equipment by griffons who use it (for further information check annex C). Airplanes also displayed high capacities for spirit-binding, however the process led to a significant increase of malfunction rates, deemed unacceptable by the Air Force Command.\nDecreased lifespan and loss of mental faculties make fielding spirit-bound soldiers impractical until these problems can be eliminated. The limited number of available magical beings allows us to use spirit-binding on only one type of equipment."

goy_pomovarra.107.t:0 "Project Megalith"
goy_pomovarra.107.d:0 "Summary Report\nSurvey teams identified a dozen megalithic circles sufficiently preserved for further studies across Pomovarran territories. Eleven of them were constructed by ancient Pomovarran druids, however the twelfth, while used by them, was a much older construction. Magical alterations make analysis of the object’s age difficult, but it’s safe to assume that it’s at least 5 thousand years old, created long before structures of a similar scale could be built by griffons. This circle is confirmed to have been used by ancient Pomovarrans, so it is plausible that later megaliths were based on this one. We found no trace of its original creators, and all symbols engraved on the stones of the circle are later additions by Pomovarran druids – except one. The oldest symbol represents a horizontally shaped rectangle in the middle of a circle. Analysis of the circle’s magical imprint raised concern among the research team, suggesting that its original function was not to passively collect residual magical energies, but to actively drain energy of every magically gifted or supernatural being within a large area. To achieve this however, the circle would have to be a part of a much larger structure, and without further findings we will not be able to reconstruct the method of such energy drain. Supposedly, several beings from ancient Equestrian legends were able to perform similar feats, however never on such a scale. Presence of this structure in Western Griffonia may hint at an answer to why so few spirits and other supernatural beings are present here in comparison to other parts of the continent, however for now it remains only a hypothesis. Findings about the twelfth circle will be classified, and current academic consensus about Pomovarran origin of the circles will be maintained.\nThe traditional method of providing energy for ritual magic is deemed highly inefficient, and it will take between several months’ to a year’s time to collect enough energy for large-scale spells. However, the twelfth structure, while not in any way portable, is a good container, fit for huge amounts of energy. By providing an external input from other circles, we might be able to collect enough energy in a more reasonable timeframe. Studies by Professor Garrec's team allowed us to replicate several druidic rituals to be performed as ordered. A new megalithic structure, based on our research and optimised through application of modern knowledge of magical theory, has been constructed in a classified compound ‘Ceirt’ and is ready for use."

goy_pomovarra.108.t:0 "Project Cauldron"
goy_pomovarra.108.d:0 "Summary Report\nMost of the druidic scriptures are written in ‘mystic runes’, a system of writing meant to protect the contents from being read by outsiders. Deciphering these writings did not require much effort, as linguists of the College of Magic have already cracked various versions of the runes used by Pomovarran druids. Incompleteness of most of the scriptures and their intentionally vague character proved to be a much larger issue. What was thought to be simple alchemical recipes turned out to be a wealth of information wrapped in layers of symbolism that cannot be taken literally. Some of the contents however made it to Pomovarran legends and rural folklore in more digestible forms, allowing for complete deciphering of the druidic texts.\nKnown in legends under many names like ‘Elixir of Vigour’, ‘Potion of Strength’ or ‘Healing Brew’, druidic concoctions took on many different forms, with various druids creating their own versions or modifying ones received from their mentors. Nevertheless, most of them used similar basic ingredients, or replaced them with components closely resembling original ones in their properties. These substitutes were, as we presume, both the result of druids trying to improve potions, and of depletion of original components’ sources, such as body parts of rare magical beasts or a now-extinct kind of flower known as ‘Eyr’s Tears’.\nRecreation of the potion ended successfully with minimal losses of lab personnel from exposure to toxic components or failed versions of the potion. As expected, upon ingesting the potions, test subjects displayed unnatural strength and ability for prolonged physical exertion, without adverse effects characteristic of commonly used performance-enhancing drugs. Overall increase of performance from our first test potion slightly improved the healing processes, however not to the extent described in ancient lore. Further experiments with druidic elixirs let us focus on their healing properties, creating a viable alternative to already available magical healing methods. While testing more specialised concoctions, we observed that the strength of performance-enhancing effects was inversely proportional to their longevity.\nLong-term potion use is subject to further research, however like with other alchemical products, is not recommended due to potential internal organ damage. The team has prepared three recipes for production. The problems we face however are high costs and limited supply of required components. Trying to replace many of them with more available products ended up decreasing the properties of the elixir. Out of the three recipes, only one of an acceptable quality can be mass-produced."

It’s seen better days, and one of the previous owners probably put too many mugs of coffee on it. Adrienne did not know why she decided to pick this specific book among the hundreds in the bouquiniste’s shop. The griffoness opened it, and to her surprise, she could barely recognise a few vaguely Aquileian words. The language seemed somehow familiar, yet also strange. It resembled neither Karthinian, Herzlandish or even Feathisian. Years of studying various griffon languages had failed her miserably. Pictures suggested it may have been a historical – or maybe a religious – book, judging by the number of regal-looking griffons and depictions of gods. Though depictions of the Trinity were also somehow... weird. Intrigued, she decided to purchase the book and went straight to the shopkeeper, a griffon so old and decrepit, he looked as if he remembered not only the Revolution, but also Grover the Third.\n“Excuse me... I’d like to purchase this book. And maybe, if you know in what language it is written, a dictionary or something...” The old griffon raised his eyes from a gazette he was reading, and paid a look to the book. His eyes widened in surprise.\n“The Boar and the Lily?” He read the title. “Ah, this... It’s Pomovarran. Few speak it here in Westkeep. Gimme a minute.” The shopkeeper started digging through piles of unsorted books.\n“Isn’t it, like, a dead language?” Adrienne asked, a bit surprised.\n“Kinda? Not really? I mean, it is here, but if you go east, some griffs still speak it. It’s just that when everyone else speaks Aquileian, it’s easier to do so as well. They don’t speak Pomovarran on television, you know.”\n“You read the title. So, can you speak it?” Adrienne asked out of curiosity.\n“I used to, but by now I’ve forgotten more than I still remember. I was born in Pomazhon, but like I said, it’s always been... more practical to speak Aquileian. Not to mention that it’s not an easy language, Pomovarran... Ah, here it is!” The old griffon produced a dusty book. “A dictionary, as you asked. Though I might have an edition of this book...” he pointed to ‘The Boar and the Lily’ “...in aquileian. I think the translation actually had more reprints. Old Camriz would be rolling in his grave if he was aware.”\n“Camriz? He’s the author, right?”\n“What do they teach you in schools these days?” The bookkeeper sighed. “Yes, he is the author, and... the founder of this country? Though, I guess, everyone was happy to let him fade into obscurity. He and lots of his compatriots would today be named terrorists, and they had quite colourful opinions...” The old griffon cackled. “I was a messenger in the resistance then. Those were the days! But anyway, I think the Aquileian edition will be better for now, but if you really want to learn Pomovarran, I can get you a coursebook...”\nA few minutes later, Adrienne left the shop. As she aimlessly wandered through quiet streets, almost dormant in the summer afternoon, she reached a small plaza. Few cafes and restaurants were still open, a buzz of griffon voices and music could be heard from them, disrupting the serenity of the moment. Things were calm and peaceful, as they usually were in Aetia – especially here, far from major cities, where life was faster. Adrienne sat on a bench and opened the book she had purchased.\n“Centuries before, when the kingdoms of the south were still young, what is today known as Pomovarra was an untamed wilderness, inhabited by fierce and warlike tribes of griffons...”"

It’s only now that we learn of our highest-ranking military officers having entered a secret pact with Pomovarrans; at first, supporting them in their war against Aquileia, and now being flooded with weapons, money, and all other kinds of help needed to revive their political cause, which has spread like wildfire among our society – and most importantly – within the armed forces. Led by baron Herman of Vorst tot Vorst, several divisions have mutineed, and now all across the nation rebels are fighting with those still loyal to the government. The baron has already proclaimed himself head of the ‘National Salvation Government’ and called his allies in the south to intervene on his behalf. War with Pomovarra is inevitable, and the rest of Herzland will be dragged into it as well. One way or another, there will be war.

Those who we thought to be loyal and well-integrated into our armed forces were being radicalised by foreign demagogues, with lavish bribes being handed out to our intelligence and army officers to turn a blind eye to the betrayal. Now we know who was behind this – Pomovarrans, who after some incredible twist of fate managed to conquer Aquileia and now turned their eyes north. Having been in cahoots with Feathisian nationalists for a long while, they stoked the flames of resistance and orchestrated an uprising – which now rages all across our western territories. Rebels, led by a former feathisian general, baron Herman of Vorst tot Vorst have taken multiple cities, with many local garrisons surrendering without a fight to join their cause. Baron Vorst has publicly requested Pomovarran help in his ‘struggle for freedom’, and the Pomovarran army responded by crossing our border!

goy_pomovarra.323.t:0 "Rogue Retiree"
goy_pomovarra.323.d:0 "Our little tropical paradise gained quite a reputation as a refuge for all kinds of expats seeking cozy retirement – to our great benefit, of course! These retirees brought with them all their – surely lawfully and ethically obtained – wealth and spent it lavishly in our casinos, bars, and other establishments meant to cater to the needs of wealthy tourists. From our local colourful collection of deposed presidents, officers of defeated armies, and banished nobles, one individual stands out.\nWhen a lone warship approached our shores, first observers thought it a brazen pirate vessel, intent on looting our islands. Soon however, it was identified as Imperatrice Giselde, an Aquileian battleship. After the Revolution, any lingering presence of our former metropoly disappeared, yet some wondered if Aquileia decided to restore their reign in this distant corner of the world. After the battleship anchored near our capital port, instead of a marine squad, a lone envoy – a diamond dog – emerged, bringing a message from his commander, Leopold Reiher. Once a Reichsarmee officer, then warlord of Pomovarra. Somehow, he managed to conquer Aquileia, and after this, didn’t even bother trying to rule it, instead loading everything of value on the captured battleship and heading for Les Meridiennes. The renegade’s offer was simple: he shares some of his astounding wealth with us in return for local citizenship and protection from anyone who would demand his return to Griffonia (not that we have extradition laws anyway). As the unspoken alternative was finding out if the crew remembered to take some artillery shells alongside all the gold, we graciously accepted the offer.\nEver since, Reiher has been a local celebrity here, with him and his merry crew of former militarygriffs, mercenaries, and other similar creatures busy recklessly spending their marvelous wealth – even with their extravagance, it would probably take several lifetimes to empty their coffers, that is, if their livers did not give up first. However, now the unthinkable happened: we ended up in a nigh-unwinnable war. As soon as news about the conflict spread across the capital, the colonel himself, still stinking like a rum distillery, requested a meeting and asked us to grant him supreme command of the defences of Les Meridiennes, which he admittedly grew very fond of. If agree, he will use his substantial wealth, connections among mercenary companies and the black market, along with his personal retinue of veteran soldiers, including the warship he arrived with – bigger than anything we have – for the war effort. As his ‘credentials’ he simply pointed out that he conquered a quarter of Griffonia starting with less. Of course, it is up to us if we want to take this offer: as Reiher bluntly put it, he’s not used to work for anyone else but himself. And if we do not want his help, he will set sail towards some even more distant destination, preferably with nice weather and a similarly lax extradition policy."

goy_pomovarra.325.t:0 "A Literal Beach Episode of War"
goy_pomovarra.325.d:0 "When the army of so-called Prince-Colonel Reiher marched through Western Griffonia, behind it left a trail of destruction and looted cities. In a way, worse even than the Storm King in Zebrica, Reiher proved utterly incapable and uninterested in any form of governing conquered lands, treating them only as a way to gather more resources for his final strike – one which shattered the ailing Aquileia, bringing an end to the rotting ancien régime.\nWhile it provided us with an opportunity to reforge our society in the fires of the Revolution, it also left a sour aftertaste of destruction Reiher has inflicted upon us. Luckily, the Colonel – in a style typical of ancient raiders – just took everything he deemed valuable, loaded it on the biggest warship he could find, left abandoned by its unpaid crew, and sailed towards the horizon.\n\nIt took some time before news of his further actions reached us. Apparently, he’d taken refuge in a place where all similar individuals go: Les Meridiennes, a former colony of the Aquileian crown, left essentially abandoned after the Second Revolution and ruled by ramshackle local government, built on the remains of the royal governorate. Harboring various unsavory individuals was an important source of income for this pathetic statelet, perfect conditions for Reiher to set up shop – or rather a battleship – there, drinking and gambling away his stolen fortune. However, justice might be delayed, but never avoided, and soon Les Meridiennes found themselves at war.\nWhile many of the ‘retirees’ hanging out there decided to leave for more peaceful places, it seems that Prince-Colonel apparently took control of the local government and started building up defences. Entire Aquileia is united in hopes and dreams of Reiher finally meeting his demise – be it in our or someone else’s claws. No matter how this barbarian meets his fate, every Aquileian will be relieved."

goy_pomovarra.329.d:0 "Hangover... Ugh, why has not a single unicorn in the world ever manage to invent some magical cure for it? It’s well-known that magic can heal most ailments – except for common cold and, of course, hangover. And so, without a cure, Reiher had to endure this entire day hung over – at least until the victory gala in the evening concluded. He should not have drunk that much with his officers last night... But how could he refuse to share a couple – or more like a dozen – drinks with his most trusted companions, with whom he’d travelled here all the way from Griffonia... and then back. Today, however, Schattenzahn, the merciless creature, dragged him to this parade. Apparently, it was important. Squad after squad of mercenaries and Meridiennese soldiers marched down the main street, while a group of important – or rather, self-important – birds, watched the parade from a balcony. Most of his comrades were as badly smashed as him; some were even napping. And then the speeches began, long tirades about democracy, restoring freedom, ending some sort of socialist tyranny and a new beginning for Aquileia and Griffonia. Reiher could not pay attention, praying for the angry spirit pounding on the inside of his skull to stop... Then he was suddenly raised from his chair and pulled to the microphone. The colonel looked around, utterly confused. What the... Ah yes, he was the commander-in-chief of the victorious army... They probably wanted him to speak too. He might have even agreed to do it like two days prior... Prior to the drinking.\n“Aerm... Soldiers! Brave soldiers!” Reiher desperately tried to collect his thoughts. “Yes, you all were very brave. I honestly have no idea how we managed to pull this off, but you know what? They will learn about us in history books and say, ‘What the heck? this could not have happened!’ But you know what? It happened! You literally did the impossible, and you were the damn best soldiers I’ve ever commanded! There is probably some future awaiting you and Griffonia, but I will not be responsible for it. I’m bad at that, trust me! But there are many griffs around, more willing to take power and much more competent than me, so it will be fine! Anyway, you did a great job! I salute–” At this moment Reiher tried to perform a military salute, instead hitting himself in the forehead, losing balance... and falling down the balcony. After a short fall, he landed in a bush, crushing it.\n“I’m OK! I’m OK!” He screamed, trying to get up, but getting tangled up in the branches.\nSeeing all this, the ever-faithful Heinrich Schattenzhan hid his face behind his paws. It seemed Reiher somehow survived a thirty-feet fall – being drunk enough to forget he had wings! – and was still alive and kicking. Indeed, the gods did favour him. But for what sins did they unleash him upon Griffonia?!"
