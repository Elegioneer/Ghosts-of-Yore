 # Margareth
 generic_neutral_leader_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: January 21, 973 ALB, Sparleto\n\n§YBiography§!: Baroness Margareth Featherin has been ruling Arantiga for the past decade with a just and fair claw, but even she cannot deny that under her reign, there has been a decisive lack of progress as Wingbardian capitalists seized most of the Arantigan industry. However, she believes that the pen is mightier than the sword, and that Arantiga's current woes can be resolved with a few careful words, something her more notable brother and general in the army, Dorotheos, disagrees with."

He spent many hours in the national library perusing the tales of old Arantigos, how he had defeated armies more numerous than his, only to be felled by the plague after his latest conquest. Since then, Dorotheos has made it his life goal to join the Arantigan officer corps, with his brilliant mind astounding even the most senior leadership. His quick rise to success can be attributed solely to his capabilities, and once he was in position to reform the armed forces, he did so with great fervour, restoring some of their old glory. But this was not enough for Dorotheos, as he wished above all to restore the ancient Kingdom. The die was cast, and the coup was a success – he shall restore Arantiga's glory.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: KelKessel"

Smitten by the local culture and history, he has invested much of his profits into rebuilding Arantiga, and unlike his fellow capitalists, his workers had a fair paycheck and numerous benefits. The dreadful coup has almost destroyed his lifework, and he was one of the first to gather his political party for the elections, campaigning on the promises of a better, peaceful Arantiga. The populace have not forgotten his contribution to the society, and he now leads Arantiga to a brighter tomorrow."

The Rozenkamp brothers' brilliant combination of ultranationalist thought and socialist economics inspired him, and he started cultivating Rozenkampist support among the Arantigan brass.\nAlthough some suspect he covertly supported Dorotheos in his failed coup, he denies all such claims, citing ideological differences between him and the late baron.\nUltimately, Ciriaco's extreme ideology found fertile ground in every aspect of Arantiga's society, even as some questioned its viability."
 # Lysimachus

From a very early age, he knew what he was destined for – instead of following in his father's pawsteps, he enrolled into a military academy. Thanks to his talent and determination, he became the youngest officer to be admitted into the Legions' general staff. Soon, he get introduced to Dorotheos. His aspirations were fascinating – restoration of the old faith and traditions, reconquest of the long-lost lands... But it wasn't words that truly captivated Lysimachus – the way Dorotheos moved, spoke; the flame in his eyes... Surely, he was blessed by Arantigos himself! Ever since that fateful meeting, Lysimachus has been adamantly loyal to Dorotheos.\n\nHe will never forget that last conversation with his master. It happened on the day before he would descend into the Abyss to reclaim the Idol, to become Arantigos Reborn – on the day before his king died. Oh, how courageously he spoke... In the ensuing chaos, Lysimachus acted swiftly and decisively – he had to protect the legacy of the Second Arantigos at all costs.\n\nIt is obvious that the death of his sovereign, whom he wholeheartedly believed to be reborn Arantigos the Great has deeply shaken Lysimachus. Though his mind remains sharp, he is prone to fits of rage and paranoia, and he has become even more fanatical than he was before. Believing himself to be the only one worthy to lead Arantiga, Lysimachus is reforging it into a state of faith and unquestionable obedience to the ruler – destroying anyone who stands in his way.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo the Pone"

Despite his dislike for Wingbardians, Nicator supported the baroness. Still, he joined the plot of Dorotheos, believing, like many others, that he would bring back the long-lost Arantigan glory. However, events of the last few years made Nicator realise how wrong he was.

 # Soter Litori
 soter_president_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: March 22, 965 ALB, Ponteles\n\n§YBiography§!: No one could predict that Soter Litori, nicknamed "Owl" by his colleagues, would ever achieve true greatness. Though a capable commander on his own, Soter was never particularly ambitious throughout his life, seemingly content with following others. As part of the Legions' high command he was considered reliable and was able to easily cooperate with other generals, no matter how great their ego was. Soter, however, always knew an opportunity when he saw one. First supporting Dorotheos' coup, later letting Nicator plan out his scheme, Soter was preparing for his own rise to power. By uniting left-wing parties and then agitating the masses through populism, he managed to win the elections, despite being considered an unlikely candidate at first. Now, as a leader he can be best described as a "pragmatist". While appearing to be a devout socialist, he cares most about his own power and uses ideology solely to further his own goals of keeping and extending his control over Arantiga. Some of his followers even created a term "Litorism" to describe the eclectic ideology of their ruler – populistic, authoritarian socialism with nominally functional democratic institutions."

Now Charles is the head of the Discret Regency Committee and de-facto leader of Aquileia. Despite his inexperience in politics, he is determined to not let the actions of the former queen go unpunished and to find a worthy successor to be placed upon the Aquileian throne."

 BOI_grandpa_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: April 1, 930 ALB, Wohnitz\n\n§YBiography§!: “Grandpa” Gruff was born in 930 ALB near Wohnitz to an impoverished noble house. In his early age he enrolled in the Military Academy of Griffonstone to later join the Royal Griffon Defense Force. Not long after doing so, he, as a promising young officer, was transferred to the Royal Guard. He rose through its ranks, becoming a captain of the Guard in the year 965 ALB. Gruff served faithfully to king Guto VI, becoming a friend and a confidant of the monarch. \nWhen Cyclops Arimaspi attacked Griffonstone in 971, Gruff led the Royal Guard to protect the Idol of Boreas. However, during the fight, he was heavily wounded and incapacitated. Being on the brink of death, he was unable to follow his king who died trying to stop the beast. The attack and its coutcome left Gruff a changed griffon.\nWith the loss of the Idol, Griffonstone entered a period of decline. The Royal Guard was disbanded, but Gruff continued dutifully serving his country, joining the Regency Council and becoming its chancellor in 983 – his impartiality making him a perfect compromise candidate. The Council soon proved to be ineffectual due to factionalism grinding all rational discussion around new reforms to a halt. Despite his best efforts, chancellor Gruff was unable to break this political deadlock, with his last hope for Griffonstone’s salvation dying with its last sovereign, Guto VII, in 992 during an expedition. Since then, chancellor has grown seemingly indifferent to all problems of Griffonstone due to grief, guilt, and old age.\nHowever, even though he may seem a bitter, hopeless, senile bird, Gruff still loves his nation and stands as its last guardian, defending its riches from greedy nobles in the Regency Council."

An orphan, said to be a son of a female cobbler from Wohnitz and an unknown father, he was taken care of by Gruff who claimed to be an old friend of his grandfather. At first, Gruff did not pay much attention to the child’s upbringing, so he mostly spent time roaming the streets of Griffonstone, looking for trouble. To the surprise of many, later Gruff sent Gallus to the Equestrian School of Friendship, where he spent a few years receiving the best education this world could provide. Returning to Griffonstone, Gallus was revealed the truth about his family – Gallus was, in fact, an illegitimate child of prince Guto VII – making him the last heir to the throne of Griffonstone. To dispel doubt from the minds of those who declared this story to be fraudulent, Gallus descended to the bottom of the Abyss in which the Idol of Boreas was lost during the attack of cyclops Arimaspi, and reclaimed the ancient artifact. This was widely considered to be the ultimate proof of legitimacy, and Gallus was crowned King of Griffonstone.\nThough young and inexperienced, he has the popular support and a few loyal griffons in the government.

A baker, she sold infamous griffonscones, considered awful even by griffonian cuisine standards, (nevertheless known as the national dish of Griffonstone). However, her life was changed by a visit of two ponies from Equestria – seemingly indifferent to problems of her homeland, Gilda suddenly changed her attitude and became a key figure of the fledgling republican movement, unifying its various groups into a proper political party.

It was during that time, when he met Oskar Plumenjar, an exiled heir to the duchy of Cloudbury, who quickly became a friend of Euan – and later, his confidant. Influenced by friendship with Oskar and sailors' stories, Euan realised how much in need of changes was his homeland, and that the only way to win the war with Skynavians was to embrace the ways of griffons – and to outmatch them. Following the death of clan Stormshield's old chieftain, Euan challenged his heir to the traditional duel – and won, becoming the new clan leader.

At the start of the Skynavian invasion, he was selected by Prince Fothad III to serve as his Right Hoof.

It goes without saying then that over the years Gordon formed a deep personal connection to the princely dynasty. This perfect life he'd grown so attached to would end abruptly on one dreadful day when a Skynavian artillery shell landed right by the prince's tent, killing Fothad with his sons and almost gravely wounding Gordon.

 ARD_allard_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 969 ALB\n\n§YBiography§!: Who was Victor Allard before the Revolution and where he came from matters little. In the old days, before the calamity of Aquileia’s collapse, he intentionally shrouded his origins in mystery. Back then, he suddenly appeared on Aquileia’s political scene, thanks to his intellect and charisma quickly becoming one of key figures within the socialist movement – yet never becoming the most prominent one.\nEven then he was called a radical, his outlook viewed as intolerable by the mainstream republican movement. The failure of the Second Revolution – culminating in the fall of Aquileia – only strengthened his convictions. As Aquileia collapsed, its armies defeated by a rogue warlord, and cities sacked by rampaging mercenaries and bandits, Allard was diligently working behind the scenes, gathering griffons disillusioned with the old republic, searching for a new purpose. And when the time came, he had accrued enough supporters to snatch power. Now, his vision unrestricted by moderates and traitors to the Revolution, Allard emerges as the sole and undisputed leader of the new Aquileian state, Le Patron. There will be no compromises and no surrender. Victor Allard will either see the ultimate success of his new Revolution – or die with it."
