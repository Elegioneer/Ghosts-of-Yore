ARA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC1:0 "From the stronghold of Romau to the city of Midoria, and from the boulevards of Aquileia to the ricefields of Sydia, stretched Arantigos' empire. Arantigos 'the Great' they called him, for he never lost a single battle. Alas, he taken too soon, and his empire collapsed with death. Now, all that remains of his legacy is the Barony of Arantiga. With Arantiga in a state of decay, a young, fanatic army general sees himself as the only hope for his beleagured nation. He will do whatever it takes to restore the glory of Arantiga, no matter the cost."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_408:0 "The §YCity§! of §YAncient Glory§!"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_408:0 "§YSparleto§!, and its sister cities of §YPonteles§! and §YAlbuvira§!, are steeped in history. One of the oldest cities in Griffonia, §YSparleto§! dates back thousands of years, before Griffenheim, before Grover, before even Equestria and her Princesses. The only record that exists of its founding lies in the story of the legendary king §YSparlos§!, first ruler of §YArantiga§!. According to legend, §YSparlos§! was exiled from his father's kingdom for attempted §Rfratricide§!, and sought to found his own realm. It is said he met §GBoreas§! himself atop the holy mountain of §YSolarspike§!, where he instructed Sparlos to throw his sword as far as he could, and where it landed, he would found a mighty city. And §YSparlos§! did so, throwing his sword west, into the setting sun. §YSparlos§! and his followers spent weeks searching for the sword, until at last §YSparlos§! found his sword lying on the shores of §YLake Rumare§!, near a quaint fishing village. And so, §YSparlos§! and his followers §Gfounded§! §YSparleto§!, and after many §Rhardships§! and §Rwars§! with mortals, monsters, and supernatural creatures, §YSparlos§! carved out his new §Grealm§!.\n\nThe next hundred or so generations of kings were simply mediocre, gradually expanding §YArantiga§!'s influence and bringing §Gprosperity§! to §YSparleto§! after dozens of §Rwars§! and §Ytreaties§!. And then came §YArantigos§!. His §Rconquests§! put §YSparleto§! on the map as the §Gcapital§! of his vast empire, which stretched from §YRomau§! to §YMidoria§!. §YSparleto§! quickly became a §Gbeacon of prosperity§! and a §Gcenter of learning§!, but this security was to be §Rshort-lived§!. Fate was cruel, and §YArantigos§! died as quickly as his empire rose. His §Ygenerals§! partioned his empire between them, but they quickly perished, falling prey to in-fighting and petty rivalries. And with them, §YSparleto§! fell into a §Rdark age§! of obscurity and poverty.\n\n§YSparleto§! today, while not a modern city, is much better off than is was a few years ago. §YWingbardian§! investment has rejuvenated the city, and tourism brings in plenty of money. All around the city, a tourist can find beautiful examples of §Yclassical architecture§!, the most prominent example of which is the §YSparleto Academy§!, standing proudly above the city. The magnificent statues and paintings that adorn these structures have inspired a whole artistic movement, §YNeoclassicism§!, and many great archeological artifacts have been recovered from sites across §YArantiga§!. A tourist can find themselves wasting the day away in one of the fashionable coffee shops that dot §YSparleto§!, as long as one is careful enough to not bump into a military patrol by accident...\n\nHowever, all is not well in §YSparleto§!. §YArantigans§! are quickly becoming the §Rminority§! in their own city, owing to the large influx of §YWingbardian§! immigrants in recent years. The ancient §YSparlean§! language is rapidly dying out, and if drastic action is not taken, it, and thousands of years of §YArantigan traditions§!, could disappear forever..."

### Naval Ideas ###
ARA_trained_marines:0 "Specialised Marines"
ARA_trained_marines_desc:0 "Although our armies have no equal in Griffonia, there are still many enemies on other continents. An entire ocean seperates us from them, and we will need special marine troops to invade them."
ARA_masters_of_the_oceans_idea:0 "Masters of the Oceans"
ARA_masters_of_the_oceans_idea_desc:0 "Although the beginning of our navy has been humble, we are now ready to rival other maritime nations. It will take time to rule the waves, but we are well on our way."

### Focus ###
ARA_the_new_airforce:0 "The Birth of an Airforce"
ARA_the_new_airforce_desc:0 "The world is changing around us. No longer do Griffons have to fly with their wings alone; powerful engines allow us to soar through the skies. We should invest in the military applications of this technology, lest we fall behind."
ARA_new_fighters:0 "Dominate the Skies"
ARA_new_fighters_desc:0 "Bombers are quite good and all, but they are quite useless without anything to protect them. As such, we should focus our efforts on creating the best guardians for Arantigan skies."
ARA_further_development:0 "Experimental Fighters"
ARA_further_development_desc:0 "The possibilities of jet engines are fascinating. We should try to adapt this technology to our military. It could ensure the dominance of the skies for years to come."
ARA_new_heavy_fighters:0 "Heavier Models"
ARA_new_heavy_fighters_desc:0 "Our fighter designs are proving to be a success, but we need fighters with the range of bombers. Sacrificing agility for endurance, armor, and weapons may be the solution."
ARA_airports:0 "Sparletan Airfields"    
ARA_airports_desc:0 "Our planes cannot fly if they have nowhere to be stored and launch from. There are plenty of suitable locations for airfields, however. We need only to approve the construction."
ARA_foregin_designs:0 "Import Foreign Fighters"
ARA_foregin_designs_desc:0 "Given the small industry we have at our disposal, it would be better to start our airforce by buying some planes, rather then relying on building our own. We can improve on them later, after all."
ARA_napalm:0 "Napalm"
ARA_napalm_desc:0 "In a war, there can be no half measures. Either we are the victors, or we suffer a most ignoble defeat. Thus, our bombers will begin carrying a more devastating weapon - napalm. After all, they can't keep the war up if all their factories are in flames."
ARA_finest_aces:0 "The Finest Aces"
ARA_finest_aces_desc:0 "A superior training program will ensure only the best fly in our planes; our pilots will be the cream of the crop! In every aspect of warfare, Arantiga shall be at the very top!"
ARA_new_bombers:0 "Salt the Fields"
ARA_new_bombers_desc:0 "Tactical bombers are good, but what we need are heavy duty warplanes; bombers that can take a beating and still survive to drop their bombs, with the range and payload to make it count. This is where the future of aerial warfare lies."
ARA_new_closer_air:0 "Refine Our Designs"
ARA_new_closer_air_desc:0 "By improving specific components of our planes we can greatly improve performance of our airfoce."
ARA_new_heavy_bombers:0 "Strategic Destruction"
ARA_new_heavy_bombers_desc:0 "Bombing key enemy positions; supply depots, railways, you name it, will require specialised planes. Designing some should be a priority."

ARA_rumare_exercises:0 "Lake Rumare Exercises"
ARA_rumare_exercises_desc:0 "Arantiga is landlocked. However, Arantiga lies on the shores of Lake Rumare, and we command a small flotilla of patrol boats. The crew of these vessels would serve as the perfect foundation for a proper navy once we have conquered a suitable port."
ARA_foreign_naval_doctrines:0 "Examine Foreign Doctrines"
ARA_foreign_naval_doctrines_desc:0 "We lack naval tradition and our knowledge of naval warfare is very limited. If we ever want to rival the well-established powers at sea, the first step would be examine and emulate their naval doctrine."
ARA_destroyer_fleet:0 "A Destroyer Fleet"
ARA_destroyer_fleet_desc:0 "Fast and deadly, destroyers are a crucial element of our navy - they guard our convoys and support larger ships. Destroyers are also easy to build, and will serve as the mainstay of our fleet until we can construct cruisers and battleships."
ARA_submarine_designs:0 "Submarine Designs"
ARA_submarine_designs_desc:0 "Submarines' ability to disrupt trade cannot be underestimated. By using them we can cripple enemies much more powerful than us; using a few submarines to destroy entire convoys and fleets."
ARA_southern_dockyards:0 "Southern Dockyards"
ARA_southern_dockyards_desc:0 "With control of the great city of Karthin, we are now in possession of one of the most important southern port cities. We should increase its naval production capacity to ensure the swift creation of the Arantigan Navy."
ARA_cruisers_development:0 "Cruiser Development"
ARA_cruisers_development_desc:0 "As our navy expands we need bigger ships with more firepower. Battleships are still out of our reach, so clearly the versatile cruiser is the next step for the Arantigan Navy."
ARA_naval_doctrine_improvement:0 "Improve our Doctrine"
ARA_naval_doctrine_improvement_desc:0 "As our fleet expands, the Arantigan Navy grows more mature and powerful. We should encourage its growth with the foundation of naval schools, the renovation of obsolete ships, and an extensive review of the naval doctrine."
ARA_marine_corps:0 "Marine Corps"
ARA_marine_corps_desc:0 "Our tanks and our infantry are more than capable of defeating our enemies, but what if they reside across a body of water? Gaining naval superiority is one thing, landing our troops is another. We will need specialised troops for this: marines."
ARA_equus_invasion_training:0 "From Shore to Shore"
ARA_equus_invasion_training_desc:0 "Across the Celestial Sea lies the slumbering giant of Equestria. A vast ocean seperates the two continents, and although hostilities between us and them are unlikely, we should prepare for any possibility. A mock invasion of Equus will serve this purpose."
ARA_arantigan_battleships:0 "Flagships of The Fleet"
ARA_arantigan_battleships_desc:0 "Powerful and invincible battleships are the true kings of naval warfare. With a fleet of them, we will be able to defeat all of our enemies!"
ARA_carriers_are_future:0 "Aerial Superiority at Sea"
ARA_carriers_are_future_desc:0 "Progress is relentless. It is clear to our admirals that battleships are quickly becoming outdated. Unburdened by years of naval experience, our navy will turn its eyes to the future of naval warfare – aircraft carriers."
ARA_masters_of_the_oceans:0 "Rule the Oceans!"
ARA_masters_of_the_oceans_desc:0 "The time has come for Arantiga to claim its rightful place as one of the great naval powers of the world. Our fleets will be everywhere and we will bring the fight to our enemies, wherever they are."

#ARA_issue_of_economic_dependance:0 "Dealing with the Economy"
#ARA_issue_of_economic_dependance_desc:0 "Arantiga's economy is in a pitiful state, and we must see to the matter of resolving this issue if we wish to become a regional power. The first task on the list is deciding our stance towards Wingbardy."
#ARA_our_own_way:0 "Our Own Path"
#ARA_our_own_way_desc:0 "Arantiga must forge its own path. If we do not make ourselves economically independent, we will be, beyond our obligations in the Pact, forced into wars with them. As such, it is time to begin cutting ourselves free from the claws of Wingbardy's industry."
#ARA_build_roads:0 "Arantigan Railroad"
#ARA_build_roads_desc:0 "If we are to become an industrial power, we will need the base infrastructure for it. Preparing ourselves for the great leap forward is a must if we are to be economically separate."
#ARA_industrial_buildup:0 "Industrial Buildup"
#ARA_industrial_buildup_desc:0 "More factories can only benefit us. Therefore, it is logical we should center our efforts on expanding our industry. We shall give subsidies to a select number of companies."
#ARA_mining_operations:0 "Ores in the Hills"
#ARA_mining_operations_desc:0 "With the recent location of new metal deposits in Arantiga's hills, we can open up additional mines to secure more resources for our economy. Arantiga must be reliant on its own resource base, and not from foreigners."
#ARA_import_machinery:0 "Import Machinery"
#ARA_import_machinery_desc:0 "We will need tractors, trucks and other industrial machines to help fuel our growing industry. Purchasing some is an excellent solution to help us meet our material needs."
#ARA_foreign_experts:0 "Invite Foreign Experts"
#ARA_foreign_experts_desc:0 "Not only will allowing foreign exports to examine our economy benefit it, they will also help with the pandemic illiteracy rampaging around our nation. Incentives, however, will be required to attract them to Arantiga. A small price for progress, nonetheless."
#ARA_industrial_revolution:0 "Industrial Modernisation"
#ARA_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "With all our buildup, we can move ourselves away from our backward technology and into the age of industry proper!"
#ARA_transition_finished:0 "The Economy Reborn!"
#ARA_transition_finished_desc:0 "With the recent improvements to our economy complete, we can finally declare ourselves our own economic power, if only a small one. Arantiga stands proudly on the results of her own efforts."
#ARA_go_with_wingbardians:0 "Go With the Wingbardians"
#ARA_go_with_wingbardians_desc:0 "Our economy is already closely tied to Wingbardy. It only makes sense that we should therefore build up our ties and use them to our advantage. While this will, of course, make us dependent on Wingbardy, there are clear benefits to it as well."
#ARA_vinyards:0 "Expand Alubviran Vineyards"
#ARA_vinyards_desc:0 "Wine is a common luxury, enjoyed throughout Griffon lands and beyond. As such, it is in constant demand. Expanding our already present vineyards in Alubvira should help our economy prosper."
#ARA_tourism:0 "Encourage Tourism"
#ARA_tourism_desc:0 "Tourism is a wonderful thing. Ponies, griffons and even zebras come to visit and marvel at the wonders of our achievements. Encouraging them so that they come to spend their money in our country, therefore, is an excellent way to bring more money into our economy."
#ARA_tax_incentives:0 "Invite Investors"
#ARA_tax_incentives_desc:0 "Investors will be needed to bring money and business into our growing economy. Inviting and offering incentives to them should allow our economy to blossom."
#ARA_cement_factories:0 "Arantigan Lumber Industry"
#ARA_cement_factories_desc:0 "Our nation, small as it is, is home to a wide variety of forests. From aging oaks to young maples, Arantiga has no lack of biodiversity. And yet we have scarcely utilised this natural resource. After deliberation with Wingbardian investors, we shall begin exploiting our forests, but for each tree felled, we shall plant two new ones. This prevents the erosion of the soil and preserves our natural beauty."
#ARA_industrial_assistance:0 "Request Industrial Assistance"
#ARA_industrial_assistance_desc:0 "Arrogance has to be a thing of the past; we must be humble if we seek to gain power to place ourselves on equal footing with Wingbardy. Requesting assistance to develop and transition our economy is therefore a must."
#ARA_cigars:0 "Pontels Cigar Factory"
#ARA_cigars_desc:0 "Cigars are an excellent investment; not only are they used constantly, but they are easy to produce and will keep the citizenry placated. Rumours of life expectancy tanking as a result of overuse are just exaggerations."
#ARA_equals:0 "A New Path"
#ARA_equals_desc:0 "Our economy is reborn! Thanks to the cooperation of our allies, Arantiga stands tall and proud. Our economic ties to them bind us all together."
#ARA_science_base:0 "Modernisation Efforts"
#ARA_science_base_desc:0 "With a developed industrial base, we can now devote our efforts toward scientific matters. The bright future in science will be ours."

ARA_GOY_new_age_new_army:0 "An Army for the New Age"
ARA_GOY_new_age_new_army_desc:0 "We are entering a new era of warfare. Gone are the days of the spear and shield; now is the age of guns and tanks. In order to face the threats of the new millennium, both the civilian and the military sectors must be in perfect cooperation."
ARA_GOY_new_academy:0 "Meeting of the Generals"
ARA_GOY_new_academy_desc:0 "Once, we were the greatest nation on Griffonia, and we can do so again. The ancient military doctrines need to be adapted to modernity. It is time to develop new doctrines, and adapt to the ever-changing ways of war. Everybody has a different idea on how. The question is: which of our generals will we listen to?"
ARA_GOY_mobile_warfare_doctrine:0 "From Zebrica with Speed"
ARA_GOY_mobile_warfare_doctrine_desc:0 "Craterus has arrived from Zebrica, and brings with him the wonders of tanks, jeeps, and trucks. While the trenches of old stand tall and strong, these mechanical beasts lumber forth, destroying all who dare stand in our way. It is clear that adopting such a doctrine will only benefit us in the long run."
ARA_GOY_develop_doctrine:0 "Lead from the Front!"
ARA_GOY_develop_doctrine_desc:0 "It is said Arantigos liked to lead his army from the front. He did not fear danger and neither should our officers. If we are to adapt to risky manoeuvres, we need to show the troops that our officers are not afraid to lead them into battle!"
ARA_GOY_cult_of_speed:0 "A Cult of Speed"
ARA_GOY_cult_of_speed_desc:0 "Speed is the deciding factor in warfare. If you can decide where to fight and who you face when, you have already won half your battles. And if we can push forward faster than they can retreat, then our enemies have no chance against us."
ARA_GOY_actual_trucks:0 "Motorised Units"
ARA_GOY_actual_trucks_desc:0 "If one unit can act, both as a hammer, and as an anvil, exploiting gaps and keeping an enemy in place, then we should make haste to reform our army into a hundred of such units. By motorizing our units, we can not only move them faster, but also supply them better."
ARA_GOY_tanks_for_the_army:0 "Rolling Out"
ARA_GOY_tanks_for_the_army_desc:0 "Our armored behemoths are ready to go forth and destroy our enemies. The tank has become a great weapon of war, which can improve our fighting prowess tenfold, when used correctly. Our foes will always find our tanks one step ahead of them, waiting for the kill."
ARA_GOY_better_tanks:0 "Legions of Steel"
ARA_GOY_better_tanks_desc:0 "It is crucial to make sure our tanks do not become obsolete. Our enemies are numerous in number, and our industrial capacity is average is best. Thus it is imperative that our tanks are the best of the world, rather than relying on numbers."
ARA_GOY_superior_warfare_doctrine:0 "Blow Them to Tartarus"
ARA_GOY_superior_warfare_doctrine_desc:0 "Arantigos has always appreciated a weapon that can strike the enemy without fear of retaliation, and artillery does just that. It is as Nicator said, 'They cannot pose a threat if they are already dead.'"
ARA_GOY_develop_superior_doctrine:0 "Knights of the New Age"
ARA_GOY_develop_superior_doctrine_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, knights have formed the backbone of Griffonian armies. While they have been largely supplanted by tanks, we have use for a hard-hitting force of armored knights, and we will incorporate them into our infantry doctrine."
ARA_GOY_mass_artillery:0 "Concentrated Fire"
ARA_GOY_mass_artillery_desc:0 "By concentrating all of our artillery fire on one location, we can not only wreak havoc on the enemy's defenses, but we can also break the enemy's will to fight. Our infantry should be able to mop them up easily, preserving our strength for when we need it."
ARA_GOY_better_artillery:0 "Modernise Our Artillery"
ARA_GOY_better_artillery_desc:0 "Catapults and ballistae have long since faded into legend, and the days of star forts and cannons have long passed. Technology marches forward relentlessly, and we must ensure that our howitzers and bunkers are a step above those of our enemies."
ARA_GOY_fancier_guns:0 "Equip the Vanguard"
ARA_GOY_fancier_guns_desc:0 "Having artillery is useless if we cannot defend them. Even with the advancements of a new age, the Arantigan soldier remains the mainstay of our army. By equiping them with our best equipment, we can prevent our artillery from being silenced by an enemy advance."
ARA_GOY_continous_planning:0 "Dedicated Officer Corps"
ARA_GOY_continous_planning_desc:0 "With our doctrine being centered around artillery, we must ensure that our commanders can put them to good use, while providing specialist training for dedicated artillery officers. This way, we can make the most out of our army."
ARA_GOY_new_school:0 "Revive the Sparleto Academy"
ARA_GOY_new_school_desc:0 "The Sparleto Military Academy in the heart of our capital has fallen into disrepair. With a thriving officer corps, it should be simple to return the ancient institution to its former glory, a place where promising officers can learn the legendary art of warfare from the best."
ARA_GOY_new_guns:0 "Equip the Army"
ARA_GOY_new_guns_desc:0 "Even with plenty of tanks and artillery, our infantry will form the backbone of our army. We need to ensure that they are fully armed and supplied with the latest weaponry and equipment, lest we suffer a humiliating defeat."
ARA_GOY_new_artillery:0 "Guns of the New Age"
ARA_GOY_new_artillery_desc:0 "No pillbox, no trench, no fortification will be able to stand up to our artillery salvos. We will force them to face us on even ground! After all, an Arantigan soldier is not worth the bones of a hundred enemy soldiers."
ARA_GOY_new_equipment:0 "Sturdy Shovels"
ARA_GOY_new_equipment_desc:0 "An infantryman cannot defend himself if he has no hole to hide in. Improving our support equipment should be a priority. An Arantigan infantryman should be able to march for days while fully packed. Surely they can carry an extra shovel or first aid kit."
ARA_GOY_spec_ops_program:0 "The Forze Speciali"
ARA_GOY_spec_ops_program_desc:0 "Unconventional warfare is the deadliest. Using new tactics, we can surprise our foes where they do not expect us. Cassander has already proved the worth of his ideas before, perhaps it is time to implement them into our doctrine."
ARA_GOY_nation_under_arms:0 "An Armed Society"
ARA_GOY_nation_under_arms_desc:0 "Tensions are rising rapidly all around us. It is clear that we cannot afford to stand back and watch the world burn. We must arm ourselves. Once, the entire nation was mobilised for conquest and if necessary, we can militarise again."
ARA_GOY_prepare_the_people:0 "Is a Polite Society"
ARA_GOY_prepare_the_people_desc:0 "Our griffons will not need to stay home and protect their families. They can join the army, since they know that in a militarised society, all those who stay behind will be protected as well."
ARA_GOY_the_cadets:0 "The Giovani Cadetti"
ARA_GOY_the_cadets_desc:0 "The Cadetti are a branch of Arantigan military scientists, tasked with developing new weapons for the military. We should expand their ranks and make sure to also task them with civilian projects if necessary."
ARA_GOY_guerilla_warfare:0 "No Surrender"
ARA_GOY_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "Surrender is the cowards’ path. We will fight to the death. Every last Arantigan will brave the perils of war, or die trying. The forests of Arantiga will be utilised for our partisan movement, with hidden equipment caches."
ARA_GOY_mandatory_training:0 "Mandatory Military Training"
ARA_GOY_mandatory_training_desc:0 "We cannot afford for everygriff to remain a civilian. Everyone must be ready to be conscripted if it is needed. Therefore, all griffons should be trained in the ways of war, so that new recruits can quickly be prepared for combat, should the need arise."
ARA_GOY_radio_stations:0 "Military Frequencies"
ARA_GOY_radio_stations_desc:0 "If you know what your enemy is up to, you have already won half of the battle. Although spies remain important, new technologies will allow us to see the world far more clearly. We should make use of this."
ARA_GOY_extensive_coscription_laws:0 "Expand Conscription"
ARA_GOY_extensive_coscription_laws_desc:0 "Our military is quite small, and as such, we need a greater proportion of bodies watching the borders. Updating our conscription laws should serve to fix this issue nicely."
ARA_GOY_military_railroads:0 "Is a Functioning Society"
ARA_GOY_military_railroads_desc:0 "A militarised society should use military precision and drill for every aspect of life. Much more can be pushed out of our infrastructure if we enforce exact timetables and sober use of seating on trains. This will effectively increase our infrastructure’s capacity."
ARA_GOY_builder_divisions:0 "Divisioni di Lavoro"
ARA_GOY_builder_divisions_desc:0 "The Divisions of Labour are a group of military engineers. These engineers specialise in constructing and maintaining the industry and infrastructure of our nation, military and civilian. It is time to give them the support they need to be more effective."
ARA_GOY_reservist_housing:0 "Reservist Housing"
ARA_GOY_reservist_housing_desc:0 "Building more barracks for our troops will allow us to significantly expand our army. A soldier who knows he is well housed, will have one less thing to worry about besides fighting."
ARA_GOY_fortified_nation:0 "Hunker Down"
ARA_GOY_fortified_nation_desc:0 "Compared to quite a few, our army is small, but elite. As such, we must secure every advantage we can that will inflict greater losses on the enemy for less of ours. It is time to dig in."
ARA_GOY_stocked_arsenals:0 "Stock the Arsenals"
ARA_GOY_stocked_arsenals_desc:0 "We cannot fight if we do not have guns. We need to make sure everygriff in our army is supplied and ready. The cost of preparation is invaluable, and the troops will appreciate our efforts."
ARA_GOY_mobilise_economy:0 "Mobilise the Economy"
ARA_GOY_mobilise_economy_desc:0 "Our economy, while reasonable, is also mostly civilian. We must mobilise it and make it ready for war. A modern war is won on the homefront and if we are to win heroic victories, we should be supplied with legendary weaponry."
ARA_GOY_legendary:0 "Making Arantigos Proud"
ARA_GOY_legendary_desc:0 "Look at us now; mobilised and ready for war. We are ready to reclaim our birth right and take our destiny into our own hands. Arantigos would be proud! We march again!"
ARA_GOY_unmatched_army:0 "An Army With No Equal"
ARA_GOY_unmatched_army_desc:0 "None can claim to command an army that is our equal. None can claim to command an army so rich in history and conquest as ours. The spirit of the ancient conqueror lives anew amongst our ranks. Glory to Arantiga!"

#ARA_more_political_freedoms_desc:0 "Although the descendants of Arantigos has been ruling Arantiga in a just and fair manner for the past centuries, it has become clear that the status quo is becoming unsustainable. Political parties will be allowed to form and run for office."

ARA_PR_victory:0 "A Victory For the Riformatore"
ARA_PR_victory_desc:0 "In a surprising sweep, the Riformatore have claimed victory in the elections. They are promising a harmonic state, similar to distant Equestria, but with our own unique characteristics. The griffons of Arantiga wish to shake off their militaristic mindset, to some extent."
ARA_welfare_state:0 "Benessere"
ARA_welfare_state_desc:0 "Arantigans are a proud people who never ask for much, but it is undeniable there is a section of society that subsists on far less than they should have. We shall implement a basic welfare system, so that griffons who have truly struck harsh times are not left on their own."
ARA_educate_the_poor:0 "Educate the Impoverished"
ARA_educate_the_poor_desc:0 "Our education program is solid, but there are still some griffons who have never received proper schooling due to their destitute situation. An improvement to this situation is in order, and we aim to completely eliminate illiteracy in the next five years."
ARA_foreign_investors:0 "Foreign Investments"
ARA_foreign_investors_desc:0 "We have done much to improve our economy in the past year, but there is still much to do, and we cannot do it on our own. Tax breaks and subsidies should encourage wealthy foreigners to invest in Arantiga."

ARA_shakes_claws_with_the_baroness_desc:0 "The Baroness, while a noble, still ruled us well for many years. Cooperating with her would not only turn the conservatives to our side, but would increase our legitimacy as well."

ARA_a_rolemodel_desc:0 "Look at us now, a proper rolemodel for Griffonian Harmony. We are truly the jewel of the South, a beacon of liberty against the staunch depravity of radicals and imperialists around us.

ARA_SDL_victory:0 "The Sostenitori Win!"

ARA_arantigan_identity:0 "Reinforce Our Identity"

There is simply too few of them, and it will take years, maybe even decades before we will able to become a truly modern nation.

ARA_industrial_front_desc:0 "Our enemies are numerous and powerful. There is no way we can reclaim what is rightfully ours without a sacrifice by every griffon in Arantiga.

ARA_homefront_victory_desc:0 "By introducing new methods, rationalising processes of production and spreading worker-soldier ethos we have achieved an astounding success.

ARA_the_legacy:0 "Legacy of Arantigos"

In the last thirty years they haven't seen much success, but they have not abandoned the dream of republican Griffonia yet. The northern government is overshadowed by the Empire.

ARA_die_is_cast_desc:0 "The Empire, Wingbardy, and Aquileia – three great powers of Griffonia who wrestle for control over the continent. Each of them is much more powerful than Arantiga and each of them has interest in claiming our lands. However, Arantigos the Great defeated armies many times the size of his own and so we will do. It will not be an easy task, but the stronger will be our foe, the greater will be our glory."
ARA_end_old_empire_desc:0 "For over two centuries Grovers ruled Griffonia. They crushed all resistance to their reign and surpassed even great Arantigos. Now however, their empire is in ruin, destroyed by Wingbardians and republicans. The child-emperor is no more than a puppet. We should end this farce before the Empire crumbles and something new emerges from its ruins."
ARA_fate_of_lord_protector_desc:0 "Ferdinand Dawnclaw was the leader of the military coup that led to the collapse of Griffonian Empire and to the end of Grovers. Even Arantigos must admit that he was a talented fellow. But the mighty griffon has fallen, now he rots in a miserable prison cell. And there is one last thing he can do for us..."
ARA_avenge_of_grover_desc:0 "Ferdinand did us a great favor by killing the child-emperor – we'd rather not get our claws dirty with poor chick's blood. Now when Arantigos proclaimed himself the savior of Griffenheim, Diamond Dogs consider him a hero. Although, we will probably never get their blind loyalty like Grovers did, the dogs will undoubtedly serve us well."
ARA_fate_of_child_emperor_desc:0 "Grover VI is just a powerless child. However, he is the last direct descendant of Grover I and an important symbol for those who hope to restore the former greatness of the Griffonian Empire. Executing a child – although being a great show of force – would surely strain our relations with Herzlanders and cause significant international reaction. We should get rid of him in a less direct manner."
ARA_force_dogs_to_dig_desc:0 "Diamond Dogs of Bronzehill are interesting creatures, they are fiercely loyal to the line of Grover. Due to malicious rumors about the true fate of Grover VI we cannot hope to ever gain their loyalty. Furthermore, they will surely try to undermine our support among other nations. So we will get rid of their leaders and relocate troublemakers to work camps, where they will do what dogs do best – dig."
ARA_triumph_in_griffenheim_desc:0 "Griffenheim – the seat of imperial power – is ours. Now no one can doubt Arantigos' right to rule all griffons. He will personally go to Griffenheim to celebrate his victory and make decisions on some matters crucial to governance of Herzland."
ARA_marriage_of_convience_desc:0 "Political marriages are as old as the nobility. Thanks to them many realms were united, many feuds ended, and many new ones started. After the death of king Moriset the Aquileian crown went to his daughter, Vivienne. Maybe, instead of fighting, Dorotheos should propose a marriage to the queen of Aquileia – and hopefully unite both realms."
ARA_royal_spouse_desc:0 "Queen Vivienne is quite an ambitious griffoness and unlike her father is actually a competent ruler. Although, allowing Aquileians to be fully independent would be foolish, surely we can reach some sort of agreement that will let us keep our western ally under control and sate Vivienne's ambitions. We are in no hurry because no matter what we do, in the future our lands will be united under one dynasty."
ARA_eastern_wind_desc:0 "Aquileian Army, although lacking in spirit, is an advanced and battle-hardened force. It would be beneficial to conduct joint military exercises to share our experience and knowledge. Some griffons in the Aquileian high command also suggested sending some of their officers to support the expansion of our armed forces – these griffons would be led by Gabriel Ostwind."
ARA_king_of_aquileia_desc:0 "There can be only one ruler of griffonkind – a Featherin – not a Discret. Although, currently Arantigos is only a king-consort of Aquileia, in time his real power will expand to that of a proper king. We will carefully gather support within the Aquileian goveernment until we will be able to strip Vivienne of her power and give control over Aquileia to Arantigos."
ARA_integrate_aquileian_army_desc:0 "With control over Aquileia we gain control over their armed forces. General staff of our armies will be merged, and, although Aquileians will keep some autonomy and will be still considered a separate formation, Arantigos will be new commander-in-chief of the Aquileian Army."
ARA_conteprise_desc:0 "With our relations with Aquileia properly established trade between our nations is flourishing. Several wealthy businessgriffs and ponies from Aquileia wish to expand their operations into Arantigan lands. Although, we have bad experiences with Wingbardians, we are now much stronger than years ago and can properly control these foreigners. So let us shake claws and make good business."
ARA_march_west_desc:0 "Aquileians are a bunch of buffoons that consider themselves more refined and cultured than the rest of griffonkind. Many despise them, but no one can conquer them. They are so powerful that even Arantigos the Great failed to do so – only Grovers succeded. We will follow in their footsteps and take Aquila into our claws."
ARA_secure_frontier_desc:0 "In the lands of Greifwald lie the largest oil fields of Griffonia. Developing this region allows us to both end our crippling lack of fuel and prepare for a future assault north due to its proximity to our border with Herzland."
ARA_oil_fields_of_adelart_desc:0 "Griffons love gold – black gold too. Newly acquired lands of Adelart allow us to easily tap into greifwaldian oil deposits."
ARA_secure_flank_desc:0 "The city-state of Flowena and the County of Pomovarra lie right next to our borders. Until now attacking them would be foolish, as it would surely cause an Aquileian invasion. However, now, when war is inevitable, we need to secure these lands."
ARA_flowenian_deal_desc:0 "Flowena is ours! Its bank vaults were sacked and our army paraded through its streets. Most citizens have already accepted their fate, they are unlikely to cause any large problems in the future. Curiously, some days ago we were approached by a former flowenan militia general with an interesting proposition..."
ARA_woe_to_the_vanquished_desc:0 "Although Aquileians fought hard, we have finally conquered Aquileia, crushing their dream of becoming the western hegemon. Now we need to deal with numerous revolutionaries that will try to undermine Arantiga as they did with Aquileia."
ARA_karthin_will_fall_desc:0 "Long ago lands of Wingbardy were a part of the empire of great Arantigos. It was embarrassing that for the last decades Arantiga was a half-puppet of its former subjects. It is revenge time now – we shall march on Karthin and depose these wannabe masters of the South."
ARA_francistrian_compatriots_desc:0 "The Duchy of Talouse is yet another country with a proud, Arantigan history. Now, with electoral victory of the LRN, they are restoring the old Talonsian traditions. We should contact their leader, Amilcare Fetivola and offer him a chance to join our rightful cause."
ARA_greater_arantiga_desc:0 "Now, after we have defeated the Wingbardians, there is no more reason for Talouse to keep its autonomy. Locals are already enthusiastic supporters of our great king and will not oppose full integration into our growing empire."
ARA_bitter_enemies_desc:0 "Falcor recently lost a war with Wingbardy, loosing its capital as a result. They have many reasons to hate their western neighbours besides that and their thirst for revenge is unsated. Maybe we should approach them and offer an alliance?"
ARA_reward_allies_desc:0 "Now, when Wingbardy has fallen, it is time to deal with Falcor. They fought alongside us... but do we really need them any longer? Their lands were a part of old arantigan realm too, and they would allow us to march further south..."
ARA_old_foes_desc:0 "By taking Karthin we ended the century of humiliation. It is time to celebrate our great victory and decide the fate of our beaten foes."
ARA_declare_arantigan_empire_desc:0 "With the greatest powers of Griffonia beaten, no one can challenge Arantigan dominance. Tens of millions of griffons bow to Arantigos. It is time to cement our claims and organise an imperial coronation ceremony in Griffenheim."

ARA_governing_empire_desc:0 "As a wise griffon once said "You can make a throne out of bayonets, but you cannot sit on it for long". If we do not want to share the fate of the infamous Storm King, it is necessary to construct a system of proper governance of the conquered lands, instead of acting like barbaric despoilers..."
ARA_our_subjects:0 "Our Subjects"
ARA_our_subjects_desc:0 "We now rule millions of griffons of different religions, traditions, and languages. Arantigans are a minority in the new empire and maintaining our cultural hegemony is implausible in the long term. Although, we will never again abandon our ways, we should consider some concessions to new subjects of Arantigos to gain their trust."
ARA_expand_cult:0 "Expand the Cult of Second Arantigos"
ARA_expand_cult_desc:0 "Griffons of Arantiga are faithful believers of the newly reformed cult of Arantigos-Boreas that has already eclipsed other cults of the Trinity in our homeland. However, most of our new subjects still follow the Three Temples orthodoxy. While undermining cults of Arcturius and Eyr would be foolish and dangerous, we should expand the worship of Arantigos-Boreas to promote religious unity in our empire."
ARA_question_of_capital:0 "Question of Capital"
ARA_question_of_capital_desc:0 "While Sparleto has been a seat of Featherins for hundreds of years, it is a relatively small city, not worthy of the ruler of Griffonia due to its inability to house the constantly growing imperial bureaucracy. Therefore a question rises: to what city can we relocate our capital?"
ARA_establish_imperial_army:0 "Expand the Imperial Army"
ARA_establish_imperial_army_desc:0 "Until now our army was mostly composed of Arantigans and central griffonian auxiliaries. It was enough back then, but our unstoppable war machine is reaching the limit of its growth. We simply lack griffons to police our lands, forget about new conquests! If we wish to protect Arantiga, our armed forces need reorganisation and expansion."
ARA_education_reform:0 "Education Reform"
ARA_education_reform_desc:0 "As our domain expanded, we got in control of various universities, research institutes, and schools. Until now we paid little interest to them. However, education is key both to creatures' minds and to the state's prosperity. By reviewing various education systems we can create new standards of education that will propagate unity and let us fully enter the modern age."
ARA_reform_the_archonates:0 "Reform the Archonates"
ARA_reform_the_archonates_desc:0 "Archons have been leading numerous followers of the Three Temples for centuries. Holding large amounts of power, they form dangerous opposition to the Cult of Arantigos-Boreas. We need to reform the Archonates to better serve the Arantigan cause. Loyal prelate Heraclius was already appointed as the new archon of Arantigos-Boreas and will lead the reorganisation of the Three Temples."
ARA_imperial_bureaucracy:0 "Imperial Bureaucracy"
ARA_imperial_bureaucracy_desc:0 "During our conquests, we governed new lands with the help of military governors and local collaborators. However, this was a temporary solution. In the long run this system is highly inefficient and is already causing us great trouble in the form of corruption and civil unrest. We need to create proper local administration, reform our central government, and establish a universal legal system."
ARA_establish_imperial_navy:0 "Establish the Imperial Navy"
ARA_establish_imperial_navy_desc:0 "For now our navy consisted of patrol boats on Lake Rumare. Our knowledge regarding creation of a proper oceanic fleet is lacking, besides we don't have experienced personnel. We couldn't capture any ships from our enemies because their crews either sunk them or sailed away on them to become pirates. We will have to create a proper fleet and organise the admiralty ourselves."
ARA_stable_reign:0 "Stable Reign"
ARA_stable_reign_desc:0 "With most dire issues resolved, our empire is no longer on the verge of collapse and semblance of normality has returned to it – finally it looks like a proper state rather than an army camp. Now we can finally focus on more important matters."
ARA_integrate_herzland:0 "Integrate Herzland"
ARA_integrate_herzland_desc:0 "Herzlanders are used to imperial reign – many of them don't even care about the ruler change – Featherin or Grover – it doesn't matter. We should finish the process of creating local administration for these lands."
ARA_integrate_wingbardy:0 "Integrate Wingbardy"
ARA_integrate_wingbardy_desc:0 "Although Wingbardy was the main reason for the misery of our nation, Wingbardians themselves are very similar to Arantigans. Because of this, they quickly accepted our reign. Wingbardians view Arantigos as one of them, and we should make use of this sentiment."
ARA_integrate_aquileia:0 "Integrate Aquileia"
ARA_integrate_aquileia_desc:0 "Aquileia has always been a thorn in the side of the Empire – and Aquileians were a thorn inside of anyone who tried to rule them, even other Aquileians. But after getting swiftly defeated by us, they've had enough of revolting – at least for now."
ARA_what_remains:0 "What Remains"
ARA_what_remains_desc:0 "Although we control the most prosperous lands of Griffonia, there are still many smaller states we have not conquered yet, their rulers are surely plotting against Arantiga, fearing our newly gained power.

Its rulers may have hoped that we will let them be – but we cannot let this enclave continue to exist. We will demand immediate surrender of Skyfall, if they don't comply, they will face Arantigos' wrath!"
ARA_just_good_business:0 "Just Good business"
ARA_just_good_business_desc:0 "Skyfall is the busiest port of Griffonia and its richest city. Having it in our possession, allows us to reap the benefits of griffonian trade. Some of the city's wealthiest citizens begged for a meeting with the emperor, probably wanting to bargain to keep their riches and remains of their former influence. Emperor in an act of mercy will listen to their pleas and decide on what to do with them."

ARA_conquest_of_the_islands_desc:0 "Haukland has been for decades the base of the infamous "mad" graf Meyer and his band of pirates.

ARA_into_evi_valley_desc:0 "With the roads to the east secured, we are finally able to enter the lands known as the breadbasket of Griffonia – Prywhen. East to it lies Gryphus and Cossack steppes.

ARA_knights_of_the_east:0 "Knights of the East"
ARA_knights_of_the_east_desc:0 "There is one thing that the east has a surplus of – knights. Hellquillians, the Order of Opinicus, Lushians – we beat them all. Some, however, did not fight against us or even in defeat, do not hold a grudge against us. Maybe we can restore their ancient role of defenders of the East – now defenders of Arantiga... Or we can finally get rid of them and bring a new age upon their backwater lands."
ARA_fate_of_trade_company:0 "The Fate of the Trade Company"
ARA_fate_of_trade_company_desc:0 "Former lands of Gryphus were home to The Gryphus Southern Continent Company that held a monopoly over the southern trade.

arantiga.1.t:0 "The Issue of Arantigan Economic Dependence"
arantiga.1.d:0 "As a small nation in southern Griffonia, Arantiga has never had the best of economies. When the Griffonian Empire collapsed, and Arantiga truly became independent, the situation worsened.\n\nBut not all seemed lost. Arantiga united with the Wingbardians to our south, and joined the Karthinian Pact in hopes of defending against aggressors and rebuilding its economy.\n\nSadly, Wingbardy used their ever growing influence over us to profit from our weakened economy. This has become a massive issue in Arantigan politics, seeing as how Wingbardian entrepreneurs and companies seize a majority of the profits made.\n\nThe question has yet to answered. How will Arantiga continue on? Will we cut ties with the Wingbardians, and strive to become economically independent from them? Or will we try and simply lower their influence, in an attempt to minimise the cons and maximising the pros of their economic 'assistance'?"
arantiga.1.a:0 "Arantiga shall control its own destiny!"
arantiga.1.b:0 "Perhaps we could become equals instead?"

arantiga.2.t:0 "The Ides of March"
arantiga.2.d:0 "Today was the day Dorotheos had been waiting for.\n\nIt was just shortly after two in the afternoon, and it seemed as if half of Sparleto was up in arms. Together with his followers, Dorotheos plowed his way through the capital city, all the way to the government district. There, the first shots were exchanged between loyalist police forces and soldiers. As the battle in the streets began to flare up, Dorotheos and his personal guard managed to breach the defenses, and entered the House of Government.\n\nMargareth stood in front of the window in her office, observing the battle. She had already called for reinforcements when she heard the first reports of the possible coup, but for now, their defences would need to hold.\n\nSuddenly, the door to her office was busted open, and as Margareth turned around, she saw her own brother, revolver in his claw, approaching her. She walked backwards, hitting the window behind her. Dorotheos armed his revolver as Margareth closed her eyes, praying to the gods.\n\nJust as he is about to pull the trigger, voices sound from outside the office, getting closer and closer, to the point where they're just around the corner."
arantiga.2.a:0 "It's Dorotheos' griffons, the coup succeeds!"

arantiga.3.d:0 "It was a sad moment for Margareth today. To see her own brother, with whom she had grown up and played with since they were both little chicks, on trial for treason. She held back the tears, at least for the moment, but she, and most likely everyone else in the courtroom knew that he was guilty, and that there was no hope in Boreas that he'd come out alive.\n\nThe trial itself did not take long. There were mountains of evidence, including witnesses, the many dead bodies in the streets of Sparleto and, last but not least, Margareth herself, whom he had tried to kill in person before her soldiers overwhelmed and arrested him.\n\nThe judge was cold, but only did his duty as he announced that Dorotheos was guilty as charged. Treason of the highest order. The punishment was none other than death.\n\nAs the guards dragged a grim-looking Dorotheos out of the courtroom, and past Margareth, she couldn't help but finally break out into tears."

Criticizing the government and the Baroness' rule was no longer punishable, and any restrictions on forming political organisations were removed as well. Soon enough democrats and national communists were spreading word of their ideologies and finding more support among the dissatisfied populace.

To the relief of most griffons, the talks have been a success, and the old nobility shall support the democratically chosen government of Arantiga.

Today, the ancient Sparletan language was officially revived and introduced as a second official language. While some citizens are annoyed at having to learn a long dead language, many see this as a great cultural revival, and welcome this decision. Additionally, this allows us to remove foreign influences from our language that we deem to be unpatriotic."

In what is dubbed "the ides of March" by the local population, a prominent general by the name of Dorotheos Featherin has seized control of the state, and is already in the process of expelling foreign influences, as he promises a return to "Arantiga's ancient roots". One of his first decisions was leaving our formal alliance pact.\n\nAlthough Arantigan history is certainly impressive, yet filled with bloodshed, the joint military staffs of the Pact believe there is no real threat coming from such a minor nation. After all, what are the chances of a new Arantigos rising up to conquer the continent?"

arantiga.001.d:0 "A cafe situated in the capital of Arantiga was filled with off-duty soldiers, among them lieutenants, generals, and even the marshal. Dorotheos Featherin sat exclusively with his closest generals, discussing a plan of great importance. Dorotheos had great ambitions, ambitions of restoring Arantiga, and today was the day he'd set his plan in motion.\n"So, colleagues, are we in agreement?" The generals looked at each other, some unsure, some appalled. "A coup, sir? Are you sure?" asked one, putting down his cup of coffee. "Of course, dear Soter. We have the support of the army, who would oppose us? Her guard? Opposing the military would be suicidal. Cassander?" He nodded, speaking in agreement, "Absolutely suicidal! All significant griffs support us."\nDorotheos  continued, looking at his third general, "Lysimachus, any objections?" He shrugged, saying, "What about those who don't? Nicator isn't on board, and many love the Baroness..." Dorotheos chuckled, grinning warmly. "Oh, Lysimachus, trust me, trust your marshal!""

arantiga.002.t:0 "The Planning"
arantiga.002.d:0 "Deep within the Arantigan countryside sat a simple homestead, only connected to the closest population center by a small dirt path. Around it, soldiers stood guard waiting for the last general to arrive. Finally, Lysimachus approached via flight, landed, and rushed in, slamming the door shut.\nLysimachus sat down with the other Generals, who all turned to him, "Excuse me, I'm late". Dorotheos looked up from the map, his annoyance masked by seriousness, "Well, Lysimachus, let me get you up to speed..." In the middle of the table laid a map, containing the latest drawing of Sparleto, the arantigan capital.\n"The plan is simple. By my order Nicator will be stationed at the border, under the false pretense that foreign revolutionaries are trying to pass it". Next spoke Soter, "I plan to keep my troops out of sight, if all goes south we'll call for backup". Dorotheos looked at Cassander, who responed, pointing at key locations on the map, "I will relieve the police chief of his burden and supplant the police force with my troops, if all goes well, the city should be under our control. Lysimachus?"\nThe next griffon cleared his throat, "Indeed, I'll have my troops stationed at all checkpoints around the city, no griffon goes in or out until Dorotheos is in charge" Dorotheos nodded, "Any objections?" The generals sat silently, the meeting was concluded."
arantiga.002.a:0 ""Then we are set.""
arantiga.003.t:0 "The Ides of March"
arantiga.003.d:0 "Marshal Dorotheos Featherin was nervous, months fo planning led to what was about to happen today. He was ready, but his chest felt heavy, filled with anxiety. This was the first time he'd lead forces, he has never fought in a formal war, nor lead a coup, his military background was comprised of drills and skirmishes with banditry, this would be the first time...\nBut, despite his lack of experience, he would handle this with tact. He would not spill a drop of blood. He needed to prevent all thoughts of a counter-coup. His clean takeover would show who Dorotheos is, and how much his people mean to him.\nHe was escorted to the palace, coming face to face with the palace's guard and his sister, Margareth Featherin, the baroness. He needed to handle this properly. He and his griffons made their way as close as they could before the palace guards demanded they halt.\nDorotheos knew what he had to do. His guards parted and he came out, megaphone in claw, unarmed (covertly he always kept a revolver as all generals do). He looked at the guards, and pleaded his case.\n"Look..." He began, the megaphone barely up to his beak, he was very well within shooting distance of the Guards. "I don't mean to spill arantigan blood, I want arantiga to prosper..." He looked up at the armed guards, "Isn't that what you fight for? Or do you fight for her? The Baroness?" He rolled his eyes.\n"My dear sister, clawless, bent her knee to Wingbardy, what kind of fight is that? Is it even a fight? Is this what you're going to die for? What's the point of her reign? I am offering you the chance to lay down your arms, and simply... Go home. Go home to your families, be it your mothers and fathers..." He lowers his voice, "...or your sons and daughters. Go home and the next time you come here, you won't be taking up arms for Wingbardy or this excuse for a Baroness!"\nDorotheos took to the sky, clenching his claw, "You will take them up for yourselves, for your families... FOR ARANTIGA!""
arantiga.003.a:0 ""Speak softly, and carry a big megaphone.""
arantiga.004.t:0 "Finality"
arantiga.004.d:0 "Dorotheos stood before his sister's chambers, having stared at the door for what seemed like hours, wondering what would happen, what he would do, how he would do it, and how she’d respond. Would she fight? Was it so silent because she had taken her life already? Dorotheos reached for the revolver on his hip, turned the doorknob.\nNothing. He entered and closed the door behind him. As if this was any old visit, raising his eyes to his ‘dear sister’. A quill in claw, she was writing on a piece of parchment. She paused for a moment before continuing.\n"Sister..." Dorotheos began, before she interjected, a shaky sound to her voice, she was on the brink of crying, "At least let me finish, this will be my last will and my testament..." Dorotheos nodded, thinking to himself how unpleasant this must be. Soon, she finished, stood up, simply stating, "Get it done."\nDorotheos looked at his revolver, loaded one round, he thought how symbolic it would be – this coup had a single shot fired, with a single casualty. And, of course, he had doubts, killing a family member is never pleasant, required or not. He knew that, had he failed this coup, his penalty for this form of high treason would be death, even if his sister did not want it.\n\nLeaders have to make hard decisions, this would be his first. He raised the revolver and pulled back the hammer. His sister said her last words as the hammer came down on the chambered round, "Ask yourself, when you sit down on the throne that was once mine-""

arantiga.005.d:0 "Arantiga is famous for its martial traditions - even after the Kingdom of Sparleos collapsed due to infighting between generals and heirs of Arantigos the Great, arantigan military training remained excellent. In fact, when Grover I conquered Griffonia, he used arantigan legions as a base for his new imperial army. Even now, there is a number of arantigan mercenary groups, renowned for their expert training, roaming the griffonian continent and other parts of the world – many of them, despite never seeing their homeland are still keeping those old military traditions alive. Now, when Dorotheos is in charge, one of these groups, Sons of Arantigos, which gained fame in Zebrica, where they fought against the Storm King's army, returned to our nation and pledged fealty to the new baron. Its captain, Craterus, suggested that he could contact other groups to try and convince them to join Dorotheos’ cause."

arantiga.006.d:0 "Dorotheos could not focus. In the last month he was suffering nightmares on an almost daily basis. He barely slept and planning military campaigns further exhausted him. He was trying to focus on the map of the border between Arantiga and the Griffonian Empire, when he suddenly felt dizzy. Moments later everything went black and Dorotheos fell from his chair.\n...beautiful. He could not find a better word. Nothing in the world of mortals could be compared to the heavenly mountains that stood in front of him. So... Is this the end? He walked forward, until he reached a garden, in the middle of which stood a gorgeous golden fountain... Everything looked exactly as the priests had told – however there were no gods and for sure, none of his ancestors... Dorotheos frowned when he realised, that in afterlife he might actually meet his sister... That wouldn't be a pleasant meeting. What if he was in hell? He had once heard a half-mad priest saying that hell is not a realm of tortures, but simply eternal solitude – worst punishment that gods could create. Dorotheos sat on one of the benches and hid his face in his claws... When he had moved them away, he was not alone anymore...\nA young white-feathered griffon was admiring one of the flowers. When he turned around, Dorotheos saw a mysterious light shining within his eyes. Somehow, Dorotheos felt like he had already met this griffon before... "Welcome, I have been expecting you for some time". Said the stranger. "Expecting me? Why?" asked Dorotheos. "Well, I have been watching you for some time and I am very impressed. You met my expectations, but I would be rather surprised if you didn't. We are in a certain way one, you and me...""

arantiga.007.d:0 "To everyone's surprise, after his sudden loss of consciousness, Dorotheos seemed... reinvigorated when he woke up. Gone were the days, when he seemed perpetually distracted, but suddenly could start screaming at servants for no reason. Most of his subordinates were relieved – the cunning general, conqueror of Central Griffonia, they followed, was back. Although doctors suggested he rest, Dorotheos decided not to delay his planned coronation – to cement his recent conquests Arantiga would be elevated to the status of kingdom!\nThe ceremony took place in recently rebuild Griffonstone – however all traces of the former Guto dynasty were removed from the palace and replaced with symbols of the house of Featherin. Crowds of arantigan soldiers and citizens gathered to participate in the ceremony that meant the return of old glory. When Dorotheos was crowned by prelate Heraclius, he decided to deliver a speech to gathered griffons.\n"Brave soldiers of Arantiga and hard-working citizens, it was a long road, but here we are... The name of Arantiga echoes through Griffonia and other nations fear and respect us. No longer when griffons hear about Arantiga they look at each other with confusion. We will restore the glory of the great Arantigan Empire... We, Arantigos, are back, and we will once again lead Arantiga into the future! Glory to Arantiga!"\n"GLORY TO ARANTIGA!" started chanting those, who already knew what their baron was planning. Others looked confused after hearing his words, but soon their voices joined the chant."

arantiga.008.d:0 "Dorotheos was resting on the throne of the late Guto dynasty. A few relics of the past, which had survived the recent refurnishment of the palace, ordered by Arantigos, laid around the room waiting to be given the attention they deserved. Much like the depraved city itself until Arantigos finally stepped in. He turned to a mosaic that depicted Grover receiving a blessing from Boreas himself. It lacked more than a few stones but still looked magnificent.\nFor a brief moment Arantigos wondered about Grover's thoughts, when he had been sitting here in this palace, planning his seemingly impossible conquests all those years ago. Could he conquer Griffonia, had he not possessed the Idol? Cracking sounds of an opening door returned him to reality. A group of his soldiers dragged in a brown-white, very loudly cursing griffoness. When they came closer, she was tossed before the throne.\n\n"We told you to do this in a civilised manner". Arantigos told the commander of the soldiers. \n\n"Lord Arantigos, she told us she had more important business than answering your questions. She called you a ‘warlord with an ego the size of the Griffonstone Tree’, and resisted arrest."\n"I was wrong. His ego is the size of the goddamned Lake Rumare!" the griffoness recoiled, looking at a rather kitschy painting depicting Arantigos the Great handing down a sword to Dorotheos. "This place was trashy before, but now it looks like an Aquileian circus!" \n"We must admit, she has guts..." said Arantigos, "...But you are not here to give me advice on decor. The Idol of Boreas. We were told, that you and some equestrian ponies were the last ones to try and reclaim it. Where is it?"\n"The Idol? It fell deeper into the Abysmal Abyss which happens to be a death trap, in case you forgot. Besides, it's just a useless piece of gold... at least so I heard. Going down there is suicide, and the idol is completely lost. No one can get down there safely because of the wind, flowing at the speed of a train. We were lucky to make it out of there at all."\n"You will show us that place..." Arantigos smiled faintly, "...and then we will see if it really is ‘completely lost’ as you said."\n"Only a madgriff would try to go down there! You're not THIS crazy, are you?!"\n"They asked us the same question when we marched on Griffonstone..."

arantiga.009.d:0 "The national revival, started by Dorotheos, goes far further than many expected. Today, the ancient Sparletan language was reintroduced as the second official language. While some citizens are annoyed at having to learn a long dead language, many see this as a return of Arantiga's greatness, and welcome this decision. Additionally, this allows us to remove unpatriotic foreign influence from our language."

arantiga.010.d:0 ""EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL, MY CONTROL!!" He screeches into the megaphone, leading a charge into Griffonia, wondering to himself, if that shot in her sister's quarters was worth this. Every time he wins a battle, every time he captures a city, every time his people cheer, seeing him, every time this phrase rings in his head – ‘Was it worth it?’. Every morning in his lavishly decorated palace he wakes up from the same nightmare: he's staring into her eyes, as cities fall and griffons bow before him, all he hears is her question – "Brother, do you still think it was worth it?""

arantiga.011.d:0 ""...and baron, that is the reason why my company is doing so poorly..." Dorotheos was not really listening to petty problems of an influential New Marelander businesspony, who asked for an audience just to complain about every single problem he faced doing business in Arantiga. Why am I listening to this? Does he really think I have nothing better to do? However the pony was not the biggest problem. The throne, Dorotheos was sitting on, always very comfortable, now seemed like torture device – Dorotheos simply could not find a position in which he would not feel pain. "Enough! Get away or I will order you executed!" He suddenly screamed. The pony froze, mumbled something apologetically, and galloped out of the room. Dorotheos rose from his throne. "Replace this goddamn chair!" he ordered his secretary. The old griffon nodded, saying, "Yes my baron, it shall be done". Over the years the secretary learned not to argue with Dorotheos, when he is in a bad mood. In the last few weeks most of the furniture got replaced, because Dorotheos ordered to remove all items that reminded him of his dead sister... "

arantiga.012.t:0 "An Unexpected Return"
arantiga.012.d:0 "Being a ruler always meant lots of paperwork, and slacking on administrative duty never ended up well. Dorotheos was reading some rather uninteresting reports, when during a short loss of focus, he saw a feather lying on the floor. It wasn't strange for a feather to appear here, griffons lose some of them from time to time, however this was not an ordinary feather... Dorotheos looked closer, then he felt like his heart had stopped for a second, and then he started screaming, "GUARDS! GUARDS!" Two soldiers guarding the doors to his office rushed inside with guns in their claws, ready to defend their baron from an intruder. Except, there was no intruder to be found, instead, they saw Dorotheos shaking in his chair, pointing at a violet feather. "WHAT IS THAT?! WHERE IS SHE?!" He screamed. Guards looked confused. One of them slowly approached the offensive item and gave it a closer look. "I think, your majesty, one of the new maids dropped it. Clumsy bird, next time she will leave feathers in tea..." Dorotheos blinked at in confusion. "A maid?" He asked. "Yes, sir, her coat has exactly this colour". The baron's fist violently hit his table, "I order her fired! She has to leave this residence now! NOW!" Guards quickly left the room, afraid of becoming the next target of their baron's fury. Dorotheos started mumbling to himself, "Yes, it was just a maid. I killed her, right? She's dead!""

arantiga.013.d:0 "When cyclops Arimaspi stole the Idol of Boreas, guards of king Guto followed him. In the following battle both the thief and the Idol fell into a bottomless rift near Griffonstone. Until this moment all attempts to retrieve the artifact failed, and many returned from the rift with nothing – many more perished in the process. Dorotheos, however, is not an ordinary adventurer - he is blessed by Boreas himself, in a way he and Boreas are one and the same – no matter what darkness he will meet, he shall prevail."

He may have been wandering here for hours... But it feels like it was an eternity. Finally the path widens...\nIn the middle of a small open room sits a hooded figure – apparently a griffon – but due to his clothing and surrounding darkness Dorotheos cannot see his face. He initially does not react to the intruder who slowly approaches him, holding the handle of the revolver on his side. However, when Dorotheos shortens the distance between them to just a couple steps, he starts speaking.\n"You are a fool to come here, young conqueror. You wish to reclaim what was long lost... In a way it was lost even before it ended up here. It is a useless item, a relic of a god that no longer cares for his creations... You think you will be blessed with its power. So foolish. Do you think you're worthy to possess the power of the Idol?""

Dorotheos can feel something watching him. But he marches forward through the darkness. After some time passes, he understands that he is lost. He wandered the maze for countless hours, but the Idol was nowhere to be found. Dorotheos panics and tries to fly up to escape the rift, the wind returns and forces him to land. After several attempts he gives up and just sits down, gazing into the slowly weakening magic spark of his lamp.\nIt is there... waiting. He needs to be patient – light keeps it away, but soon, the light will fade. The lamp eventually fails, Dorotheos smiles to himself and closes his eyes.\nHe only hopes that the gods will be merciful... That is, if he will ever get out of this cursed oblivion."

The griffon points his claw at one of many paths, "I will be watching you, conqueror. As I always was".\nDorotheos decides to go into the path, chosen by the hooded figure. He does not look back. Somehow, he knows, that he would not want to see what may be behind him. After several minutes of walking, he approaches something that seems to be a palace hall, carved in stone. What a bizzare place for such construction. Who is this made for? He passes numerous columns, their top parts fading in the darkness above, he spends some time looking at statues depicting numerous griffons – all of them wearing crowns, diadems and other symbols of royal power. He recognises some of them – king Guto VI, Kihai de Kissau, Gerad Discret... Finally he approaches the end of the hall.\nAt the end stands an empty throne, words, carved in its foundation, spell, "Grover of Griffonstone". Next to it lies an old sword covered in rust... Dorotheos felt like something was waiting for him to act. But how?"

arantiga.023.d:0 "The time to rest has not come yet. As Dorotheos grabs the old sword, he comes to a realisation – Grover did not wait, he acted. He did not stay in Griffonstone – he moved forward and conquered countless nations. He must do the same – it is his destiny. Perhaps, he will never find peace... But he is not looking for peace, he craves war and glory. When he rises up, he sees a passage he failed to notice before.\n The road is getting more and more narrow as Dorotheos moves through it – in the end, he has to squeeze himself through a gap between two rocks. At last, he enters another chamber. He is certainly not alone, he feels it. He clenches his claw on the ancient sword...\n"Brother... you have finally come". Dorotheos knows this voice, and he knows that its owner can't say these words. From the darkness emerges his long dead sister, Margareth. She seems sad... "It has been a while, hasn’t it?" she asks. "You are just a ghost of this cursed place. You are not real". Replies Dorotheos. "Am I? What if you are dead just like me? You died in this endless void and now wander here, alone, haunted by your doubts and past sins... You can't go to Heaven. This is the right place for you". Dorotheos frowns hearing these words. "What do you want?" Margareth smiles warmly, "I came here to help you. You need a guide, someone to show you the way". "And why would I trust you?" suspisiously asks Dorotheos. "I am your sister. I still love you, even after what you've done, Dorotheos".\n\nThe king slowly approaches the ghost of his sister..."

Dorotheos lets the sword fall on the floor and stands in silence for a moment, before continuing his journey. When he "killed" her for the second time, he felt nothing... He wondered if it would stay like that.\nAfter what felt like an eternity, when the light of his lamp faded almost completely, he saw a small reflex of light shining from under a small pile of rocks. As he approached his reward revealed itself – the Idol of Boreas. Picking it up, Dorotheos felt nothing special... It was a bit warm but showed no signs of supernatural powers, the voice of Boreas did not speak to Dorotheos. But without any doubt he was holding the Idol. He chuckled quietly. So was it all for nothing? Well, perhaps it would not make him an undefeatable warrior like Grover, but griffons would definitely believe that he is the chosen one. Is this a good enough reward?\nWhen Dorotheos started climbing, winds seemed weaker than before, as if something shielded the king from them. He was climbing for hours, but finally he reached the top of the rift. His guads were relieved to see their ruler alive and well. And when he took out the Idol from his bag, they were mesmerised. Some of them knelt and started praying to Boreas. Dorotheos put the ancient artifact back into the bag and sat on the ground, catching his breath... He then looked back into the pit and gave an order. "Destroy it. No matter how many explosives it takes I want it to disappear"."

Smaller groups were sent to capture key points in the capital and place it under lockdown. However, the plan crumbled when the main force failed to break through the palace's guard, which, unlike during the Ides of March Coup, fought 'till the last griffon, buying enough time for loyalist forces to gather and push back the rebels. Skirmishes were happening throughout the day until the last pockets of rebels surrendered. Nicator was captured and brought before the king.\n\nNicator stood before his sovereign in complete silence. Dorotheos saw no fear in his eyes – only contempt. "Why did you betray us? You were a part of our staff, you fought with us. When the final victory would be ours, your rewards would be immense. And yet, you turned against us – Arantigos..."\nNicator spat on the floor, "This is exactly why I turned against you, Dorotheos. We? I followed you because I believed that you would restore our nation – believed even when you killed the baroness! But you became a power-hungry maniac. You consider yourself a god! How much more will you need to twist and squeeze Arantiga to win? Will all the suffering you've brought upon your people be worth it? Will it be worth it, Doro..."\nBefore Nicator finished his sentence, Dorotheos grabbed his revolver and swiftly unloaded all six chambers. Guards trembled, seeing pure anger manifest on Dorotheos' face. He kept pressing the trigger, but the gun only clicked.

Located on the northern shore of Lake Rumare, it had been an estate of a local duke, until Dorotheos confiscated lands and riches of the old nobility. Many of them got sold - Arantiga was in desperate need of money to fuel its constantly expanding war machine, but some of them were given to chosen associates of the king. Traversing the vast garden of the residence, Soter noticed a lack of servants – only a few soldiers of Nicator's personal division were standing guard here. The whole place seemed like a military HQ. His host welcomed him on the porch and, after shaking claws, they sat down in comfy chairs. A young griffon in a corporal's uniform brought a bottle of local wine and, saluting the generals, quickly disappeared. Soter addressed Nicator, \n"So, my friend, I must say, you obtained the crown jewel of Rumare, but, I guess, showing it to me was not the reason you invited me, was it? All these soldiers, loyal only to you... You clearly want our conversation to remain between us."\nNicator smiled faintly and took a small sip of wine, "Indeed, Soter, indeed... You are one of the few griffons of authority I can trust. Lysimachus is a mindless fanatic, and Craterus has only recently joined our ranks. These are dire times when trusted friends are few and hard to come by. I believe the time to act has come, soon, we will be dragged into a war we cannot win. Dorotheos... He is mad. You heard his speech during the coronation – he thinks, he's Arantigos! This is madness. He wants to wage war against the entire world! He will lead us to certain death!"\n"Well, it had seemed we could't defeat Griffonstonians – until we tried, and here we are..." Soter chuckled, "Here we are, enjoying the boons of an improbable victory. But I must agree with you, this has come too far. The captain of the royal guard is a good friend of mine, he's been telling me some disturbing stories lately. I too think that Dorotheos is slowly losing his mind, but he hasn't failed us so far. And the soldiers love him, they will follow him to the end, be it bitter or sweet. In the face of certain defeat, Lysimachus will rather die than betray him. Cassander, I guess, will follow him too."\n"What about you?" asked Nicator.\n"Me?" Soter stayed silent for a while, "We are surrounded by enemies – Aquileia, the Empire, Wingbardy – They will come for us at some point. We need Dorotheos to win. Even if he is a madgriff, he is still a brilliant commander." Soter finished his glass of wine and concluded the exchange, "I will pretend we've never had this conversation."\nA few hours later when Soter had already left the residence, he knew it was time to start acting.

Dorotheos had no time to care about shadows as, like often these days, he was working late.\n Numerous ancient books and much more modern reports were piled on the table as he was reading everything he could find about the Abysmal Abyss. There were many stories, feeling like cheap horror novels, but nothing really useful. Just myths, rumors, and legends. As he was deciphering an especially old book written in antique version of griffish, light bubbles suddenly flew out of it.\n Dorotheos raised his head. All griffons were, in heart, predators. Although their senses were dimmed by ages of civilisation, he felt like he was not alone here.\n"He seems interesting, doesn't he? He reminds me of you, father, before you let yourself get killed by an insubordinate soldier. Like you, pursuing glory and conquest, he brings despair to people."\n"He is nothing like me! He is weak, he falters, and he is sullying this place. This is the home of the greatest dynasty to ever rule Griffonia! He's a scion of a long forgotten king who achieved only a fraction of what we did!"\n"You are too harsh with him" the third voice laughed raspy, "We should wait and see if he is worthy. He's making good progress, but he can't rest on his laurels if he wants to excel. I was not sitting here and deliberating. It is not the way of the conqueror."\n"Who the Tartarus are you all?" Snarled Dorotheos, clutching his revolver, "Show yourselves, intruders!"\n"Intruders? Who's the intruder here?" Dorotheos heard behind his shoulder.

However, the bulk of the Arantigan army ended up following Lysimachus – the most loyal of the deceased baron’s generals. Infuriated by the news of Nicator claiming regency, he ordered his troops to march on Sparleto.\n\nNicator knew that he had nowhere to retreat, and that his victory or defeat would define the future of Arantiga. All healthy male griffons of the city were conscripted. Equipment was scarce – those who didn’t receive a gun were ordered to dig trenches and build barricades. Then came the fateful day. The army of Lysimachus arrived, directly attacking the city in hopes of crushing the morale of its defenders..."

Until a deafening screech broke the silence – due to blind luck, a stranded artillery shell landed directly on the forward command position, killing Lysimachus and his most loyal officers...\n\nWith the death of their general, attackers fell into disarray.

When it became obvious, that the situation was hopeless and there was no chance of retreating, Nicator put a gun up to his head and pulled the trigger – soon after, the remnants of his army surrendered.

And so, political treaties, all sorts of foreign or non-arantigan religious literature, and many other “frivolous” writings were thrown into piles and set on fire – followed by every other seized “dangerous” flammable commodity. Those who tried to oppose the soldiers were brutally beaten, in extreme cases, hanged, shot, or even thrown into burning piles of paper. In cities of the new empire, libraries burned. Museums, churches, and all other places of culture were ravaged by frenzied followers of Lysimachus. And, after a few days, when the monuments of old had fallen and balefires had gone out, life began anew. Life, in which there was only one truth – the one preached by the state – the one praising the Immortal Emperor and condemning all those who opposed his regent as mortal enemies."

arantiga_chaos.024.d:0 "Day when Arantigos II perished was the worst day in the life of Lysimachus – the griffon he had sworn to follow until the bitter end, the king who represented the last, best hope for restoring Arantiga’s greatness was dead. And, like in the days of yore, when Arantigos the Great died, vultures flocked to tear his kingdom apart. All seemed lost. The Sun had set over Arantiga. In days that followed, Lysimachus would go into destructive rages ending in quiet sobbing. Alongside that, he had to do so much – he was the only one who could lead Arantiga after all. So many problems to solve, so many projects to oversee. His servants and adjutants quickly learned when to avoid Lysimachus to not become targets of his wrath. At times when anger burned out, and sadness passed away, he could be seen sitting in his chair, staring mindlessly into wall. He had beat the rebels, then despicable Southrons... What was he to do now? One day, when after many hours of work, he finally fell asleep, curled up on his chair, a dream came to him...\n\nHe stood alone, surrounded by shadows, in a bizarre, dark maze of stone corridors. Long had he traversed it trying to find a way out – to no avail. He saw no-one else in the darkness, but he felt something... A lingering presence hiding somewhere in the shadows. Every time he tried to focus on it, it would vanish, only to reappear later. It seemed like ages had passed, but, finally, he found something other than endless tunnels – a large palace-like hall filled with statues of kings of the past – all of them were kneeling, their heads lowered in a bow to a statue of Dorotheos Featherin – the Second Arantigos – sitting on a throne. This statue seemed almost alive... Marveling at the scene, Lysimachus was suddenly struck by a ray of bright light, powerful and majestic, making him fall and cover his eyes. Suddenly, a voice rang out,\n\n“Rise! Rise and serve me, as you did before! You shall be the first among those who will subjugate the faithless and create the holy realm of Arantigos in the mortal world!”\n\nLysimachus awoke in cold sweat, but his mind was clear as a crystal – the truth had been revealed to him. Now, there was only one god worth worshipping – Arantigos, merged with Boreas, the Immortal Emperor of griffons. And he, Lysimachus, was his herald, his high priest tasked with spreading his truth in the world of mortals."

Of course, a large part of Karthin’s historical districts will have to be destroyed to make a room for such a structure... Not much of value will be lost – despicable Wingbardian architecture of the city’s central region will be replaced with Arantigan buildings that will show superiority of our nation over foreign heretics.

Under his reign, Arantiga turned into a nightmarish hellhole, eclipsing even the horrors of the rule of the „Mad King” Dorotheos. In arguably the worst display of his madness, Lysimachus banished all ponies who lived in the Griffonian South. Stripped of their property and exiled – crowds of horrified refugees – they flock towards New Mareland. The scale of this atrocity is so severe that we’re hardly able to provide them with food, medication, and shelter. However, it is our duty to help our oppressed brothers and sisters... But that’s not all. Even more dire news is that we have reasons to suspect that conquering Mareland itself will be the next goal of Lysimachus! We must prepare ourselves for our finest hour."

While banishing him to Equus would make it much harder for them to perform subversive activity, it does not guarantee our security from a possible reactionary uprising. However, there might be a more effective solution. Recently ravaged by war, Herzland is not a safe place. Accidents happen all the time... We could order the young emperor to move to a distant residence... for him to never reach it. The military convoy, in which he will be transported, will be attacked by a group of well-armed monarchists – our most loyal operatives in disguise. Poor Grover will accidentally die in the ensuing combat – killed by his own “loyal servants”. What a shame! Of course, said servants will have to be quietly disposed of later to ensure that no one finds out about our involvement.

Few lucky ones turned back early on in their descent into this seemingly endless deathtrap, most, however, were lost. But now, an effort greater than ever before was being undertaken. Dozens of skilled mountaineers, often forced by Arantigan soldiers, ventured into the depths of the Abyss. Their task – find Dorotheos or whatever remained of him. Were they to fail, they would face certain death at the claws of Lysimachus’ soldiers. And so, for weeks they tried – and one by one they died. Some – to rocks crumbling under their claws, others – to sudden gusts of wind; unknown remained the stories of those who did make it down to the bottom – no one returned from the depths to tell them. And yet, Lysimachus sent wave after wave of griffons – he still clung desperately to hope – Arantigos, the Chosen of Boreas himself, could not have simply died! He personally oversaw the entire operation – and, as time passed, spent more and more time standing at the edge of the Abyss, looking into it as if he was hypnotised. His adjutants quickly learned it was a very bad idea to disturb him then – it often ended with fits of rage – and, in one case, with execution of an unfortunate lieutenant on the spot. Eventually, Lysimachus was forced to admit that his efforts lead to nothing. As the surviving mountaineers were dismantling their camp, general stood in silence by the edge, thinking. Was his king really lost? What then? Who will lead Arantiga to greatness? No griffon was worthy to do so. Or was there one? Was it up to Lysimachus to finish what Dorotheos had started – to make his dream of a great, pure Arantiga a reality? Yes, he would do that..."

Yet, he did not complain – the feeling of ultimate control was... intoxicating. He had always yearned for it – and now he finally got it. Not by screaming loudest out of the bunch, but by outsmarting his competitors. Now however, in the evening, when all urgent matters had already been dealt with, he could enjoy a moment of peace and reflect on the past events. Right after the death of Dorotheos, it was enough to wait and let Nicator kill Lysimachus, then wait more for this apparently hopeless idealist to give up power – and then, Soter had the perfect opportunity to seize it. Now, after the conquest of Herzland, he was more than a president – a national symbol – a hero who ended centuries of humiliation, who brought ‘freedom’ to Herzland, got rid of nobles and greedy oligarchs... Eliminating all who could oppose him. With hundreds of his frenzied supporters surrounding the parliament, members of it nearly unanimously voted to make Soter president for life (in all honesty, the crowd was just for show – most of the parliamentarians have been bribed in advance). Of course, this didn’t grant Soter absolute power per se; but, with the parliament being more of a tool to manipulate popular opinion than a properly empowered institution, it might as well have.\n\nSoter quietly cackled – all was going exactly as he had planned back on that very day when Nicator revealed the plans of his coup to him. Nicator’s plan was successful, but the real victor was Soter – and, with some effort, he would be remembered as the true hero of the revolution. After all, it was much better to be respected by his people, than just feared. The future looked bright – and he would be the one to shape it."

Only when army units arrived, the protesters were dispersed. However, this had only worsened the situation – the Sicameonese started an outright guerilla war against us.

INCOMPETENT MORONS!” suddenly screamed Lysimachus, “How could you not have dealt with these rebels yet?! They are just a bunch of peasants with old guns and pointy sticks – and you are commanders of the finest army in the world! You are a shame to the Legions! ALL OF YOU!” Lysimachus stopped to catch his breath.\n\n“But Regent, sir...” a griffon in a colonel’s uniform, apparently the bravest of all generals in the room started to speak, “We were unprepared to fight in jungles, partisans have support of the local population, and...”\n\n“Those are just excuses!” Lysimachus rose from his chair, “I want results, not EXCUSES! If there is a jungle, burn it! If locals keep supporting the rebels, kill them. Arantigos will sort out the guilty! I’ve had enough of this parody of war, I want them dead! You will go there and command your troops to kill anyone who seems suspicious, to burn every village that supposedly supports the partistans, and execute every protestor on sight. IS THAT CLEAR?”"

Fires could be seen from many miles away, the ground was covered in a thick layer of black ash. The rainforests were burning along with all creatures living in them – animals, griffons. Even battle-hardened Arantigan soldiers were sickened by the smell of burnt flesh. Innumerable lives were put to an end. In many places the fire ran out of control, consuming not only the jungles, but also surrounding villages and towns. Finally, it seemed that Sycaea herself took pity on her aching land – and heavy rains had started. While they extinguished the raging fires, all the accumulated water turned into massive, destructive floods.\n\nWhile all accross Sicameon villages were struggling against the floods, the Arantigan high command decided to fight the partisans by depriving them of access to food and shelter. Crops on the non-flooded fields were destroyed, all peasants suspected of supporting the rebels were executed. Those who were unable to prove their loyalty to the goverment were banished from their homes and stripped of their possessions.\n\nOver the months of war, thousands heard loud knocking of fists and rifle butts on their doors – protesters, suspects of supporting protests, intellectuals, priests of Sycaea – were dragged out of their homes and executed, their families were sent to the work camps. Tanks rolled through the streets of once prosperous cities, and legionaries destroyed what little remained of monuments built over the hundreds of years of Sicameon’s history.\n\nAnd so, after many months of murder an destruction, nothing but silence was heard from Sicameon. Those who dared to oppose their new ruler before were dead – some would live on to quietly tell stories of former freedom.

We can't control all those griffons using only our loyal arantigan citizens, if we want our regime to survive, we will need to delegate power to locals.\n Probably the safest choice would be relying on Wingbardians and other southerners as the new dominant group of the Arantigan Empire – most of them support their new ruler – Arantigos. In fact, despite our attempts to restore the old sparlean culture, arantigans remained very similar to Wingbardians. Another option would be to support the largest ethnic groups – Aquileians, Herzlanders and Wingbardians, letting them assimilate minorities. Conversely we can establish laws protecting freedom of all nationalities within our Empire, hopefully gaining their sympathy for our cause at the expense of our centralisation and government integrity."

arantiga.051.d:0 "For centuries Sparleto was the seat of the Featherin dynasty. The ancient city has a long and proud history. However, as our empire grows, so do the needs of its government. Sparleto is simply too small – it can’t hold all the necessary institutions and offices. Besides, its rather provincial character obviously does not suit its new status of the imperial capital. To better govern our empire, it would be reasonable to choose a bigger, better strategically located city as our capital. The best candidate is Karthin – the former Wingbardian capital, it would be easy to govern, as its population is not hostile to us. Some however suggest that Griffenheim, the seat of Grovers would best fit the splendeur of Featherins and, thanks to its location in the center of Griffonia, would make governing our empire easier. But there's also the third option: instead of moving, we could make Sparleto worthy of our emperor by starting an ambitious program that would expand the city into a proper metropolis. The cost of such undertaking would be quite substantial and we would have to demolish and rebuild many historical districts. This, however, might be the best option, as Sparleto's location makes it unreachable for enemies and allows for easy governance of our lands."

There is no doubt about it, citizens of this great city, the second age of arantigan glory has come, and with it came new opportunities for all of our subjects. A dozen years ago travel from Ponteles to where i'm standing took 3 times longer than it does now..."\n\n\n\n                                Extract from a speech given by His Imperial Majesty Arantigos II in Sparleto,[GetDateText]."

arantiga.056.d:0 "In frozen northern tundra, since times immemorial, live tribes of ponies. For centuries they paid little interest to matters of the civilised world, and not even Grovers cared enough for these desolate lands to conquer them. Now however, ponies found themselves in a conflict with skynavian communists, who invaded their homeland. When arantigan legions marched north, we conquered Skynavia and the northern ponies. Now it is time to deal with them – as their lands are sparsely populated we can simply integrate them into our empire. However, currently we can gain little profit from them, and making them usable will strain our economy and cause dissent among the locals. Perhaps, it would be easier to create an autonomous region for them..."

arantiga.057.t:0 "Riches of Skyfall"
arantiga.057.d:0 "After their defeat at the claws of the great armies of Arantigos, Skyfall now stands under our control. Keeping the current ruling oligarchs in charge of city for now will provide a better image of our occupation forces within the minds of the populus, therefore keeping them peaceful, as well as ensuring the loyalty of the ruling class. On the other hand we could strip these facetious oligarchs of their possessions and establish full control over their former property and the city. This will undoubtedly anger Skyfall's oligarchy, but they aren't in any position to resist the decisions we make. Because if they try, they will face the wrath of the great emperor of Arantiga and the imperial military."
arantiga.057.a:0 "Let the oligarchs be, they are best suited for the task."

arantiga.058.d:0 "Came news of great urgency – apparently some wanna-be god-emperor from the continent, Dorotheos Featherin, after somehow beating Aquileia, the Empire, and Wingbardy has decided to finish what he started – and now the arantigan fleet is headed towards Haukland. Right now is our last chance to pack up all the loot we have gathered and move to some nice, warm place... Macawia perhaps?"
arantiga.058.a:0 "Maybe it's time for retirement..."
arantiga.058.b:0 "NO!"
arantiga.059.t:0 "Abandoned Haukland"
arantiga.059.d:0 "As our forces were approaching Haukland, they were getting suspicious – not a single attack got carried out by local pirates. When the first batch of troops landed, they expected an ambush. However the islands were deserted – apparently most of the pirates either left the place or were hiding from us. When the locals got questioned, the truth was revealed – apparently the mad graff and his most loyal supporters packed up all the treasures they could and set sail to one of pirate safe havens. The remnants of his ragtag "army" ran away on their own. They are not our problem anymore."
arantiga.059.a:0 "That was unexpected!"
arantiga.060.t:0 "Haukland will fight!"

arantiga.061.t:0 "Knights of the East"
arantiga.061.d:0 "When Grover II started his doomed to fail crusade against the eastern ponies, he founded several knightly orders. After his death, those knights established themselves as defenders of the East and in some cases even created their own states like Hellquil and Longsword. While in western Griffonia the age of chivalry ended long ago with the beginning of the industrial era, in less developed lands of the East these traditions remained alive and in some cases got twisted beyond imagination. Now Hellsword and the Evi Valley are parts of our Empire and the future of knightly orders is uncertain. There are two options for them: either we allow them to exist under our guidance, joining them together with our own knights, such as the Sons of Arantigos, or the orders get disbanded and their soldiers get drafted to serve in our regular army as officers."
arantiga.061.a:0 "Our knights will fight together!"
arantiga.061.b:0 "Their time has come to an end."
arantiga.062.t:0 "The Trade Company"
arantiga.062.d:0 "Gryphus Southern Continent Company was institutionalised under an imperial charter granted by Grover III, which gave them rights to trade in the Gryphus Sea. Although with the collapse of the Griffonian Empire that charter became no more than a regular piece of paper, thanks to substantial influence the company held, they maintaned a strong position in the southern seas. It being not as influential as the bank of Flowena or oligarchs of Skyfall, Arantiga paid little interest to the Trade Company. Now however, when we are in control of Gryphus, the time to tie up this loose end has come. The Company is still successfully operating, and we could let them be, as long as they pay their taxes, bringing large sums of money into our budget. The new competitive environment won't allow them to hold a monopoly over the eastern trade, but in this case, they will stay as the dominant player in the region, slowing down growth of the local economy, therefore, another good option would be to nationalise their assets."
arantiga.062.a:0 "Let them operate."
arantiga.062.b:0 "Nationalise them."
arantiga.063.t:0 "Fate of Asterion"
arantiga.063.d:0 "We are now in control of The Asterion Archipelago – the home of minotaurs. For centuries minotaurs have been resisting the imperial rule and finally won their freedom in the Restoration War of 979. Bulls are known for their stubbornness – even now their guerillas fight our Asterion occupation forces. Controlling their islands will be a nightmare. It may take many years before we will be able to establish stable rule. Perhaps it would be better to grant minotaurs self-governance, by making them an autonomous region of the Arantigan Empire, and make sure that rights of bulls on the continent will be respected?"
arantiga.063.a:0 "No deals with minotaurs!"
arantiga.063.b:0 "Leave them on their islands."
arantiga.064.t:0 "Imperial Nightmare"
arantiga.064.d:0 "After the fall of Cloudbury, many republicans tried to escape or retreated into mountains to continue the fight from there. Arantigan intelligence cooperated with the military, conducting raids on mountain holdouts to finally eradicate the republican threat. However, killing the rebels was not the true goal of the operation – the main objective was to capture as many prominent republican leaders as possible, especially Kemerskai himself. After a month of clever sabotage by the intelligence and unrelenting assaults by the army, the operation was successfully concluded. President-Marshal was publicly executed a day after his capture on the main square of Cloudbury. Many of his subordinates were not as lucky – they died during or after lengthy interrogations, often with use of tortures, in which information about republican cells wes being gathered gathered. In following months after the operation executioners across the Arantigan empire worked relentlessly, while work camps once again got filled up with new batches of prisoners arriving daily."

arantiga_govern.012.d:0 "Republicanism was crushed – the so-called President-Marshal is dead and so are his cronies. Most of those who are still alive either fled the nation or hid, leaving their ambitions behind. But even after we proved the "Republican Dream" to be just a chickish fantasy, many influential pro-republican groups remain in our empire, spreading propaganda among the locals, who criticise actions of the central government alarmingly often now. Ruling with an iron claw won't be hard for a while, but as memories of victories fade, dissent will rise once again, ultimately leading to a revolution. We can crush every sign of resistance and keep the absolute power of our divine emperor – but will this be a time-proof decision? Some businessgriffs and nobles propose a form of political representation for various social classes – The Imperial Parliament. We will build a magnificent edifice for representatives to argue about meaningless problems... The people will be too busy observing them arguing to turn against the government. We could also use these representatives as counterweights to local officials, making the Emperor look like a ruler, deeply concerned about well-being of his subjects, a ruler, who listens to pleas of common griffons oppressed by local governors..."

arantiga_govern.013.t:0 "Faith and the Throne"
arantiga_govern.013.d:0 "Griffonia is home to many griffon nations, who worship different gods. Of course The Trinity is the dominant faith and most griffons in one way or another worship it. However, even within The Three Temples ceremonies vary wildly between regions. Because of this, keeping orthodoxy intact was a hard challenge for generations of archons. But there are also worshippers of minor deities like Eviliana or The Wise Lady, strange cults like The Old Believers, the druidic pantheon of the eastern ponies, who worship their own gods and spirits, and many more quasi-religions, making religious regulation on the continent a total mess. When The Arantigan Empire was established, alongside it spread the cult of Arantigos-Boreas and the cult of Second Arantigos. As we took control over the archonates of The Three Temples we reformed them to follow our new version of the faith in The Trinity, This, of course, created a substantial resistance among traditionalists and led to several schisms. Fortunately, it seems, most griffons managed to adjust to the changes and, hopefully, The Imperial Cult will sometime become a pillar of The Empire’s stability. Zealots suggest we should further spread The Cult of Arantigos and issue the Edict of The Imperial Cult, making it not only the official religion, but the only allowed religion inside The Empire. This would be a borderline insane decision, millions of griffons would resist it, unwilling to abandon their gods, it would send the country into a period of strife, critically undermining stability of Dorotheos' reign short-term, but ultimately creating a more homogeneous religious environment, allowing for better control and stability in the future. In contrast to that, issuing the Edict of Tolerance, that would let followers of religions non-hostile towards our regime (Excluding mad murderers, such as Maarites!) praise their gods freely, would be a much safer option for now."

arantiga_govern.014.d:0 "They kneel before the throne, they praise the emperor's rule, they bow to him... but Arantigos sees it in their eyes – they do not really respect, nor fear him. Nobles believe, that their blood gives them rights greater than those of an heir to the dynasty that reigned for sixteen centuries. They plot and scheme in their mansions, hoping to regain their lost power, to outmaneuver the "upstart baron" and reclaim what is "rightfully theirs". They never truly accepted and will never accept the new reality. But their time is gone. They are, however, not powerless yet – they can still be a threat. Perhaps it would be best to get rid of them – strip them of their titles and remaining privileges – there will be only the emperor and his subjects... But could there be another way? During the war there were many, who proved themselves worthy, who deserve to be put above the masses..."

arantiga_govern.015.d:0 "As dust settles, the Arantigan Empire emerges as a firmly established dominant superpower of Griffonia. The end to our conquests is coming, now we can finally stop concentrating on making tanks and planes. As military production takes up less resources, the civilian industry is starting to expand. Pirates and bandits were defeated and hostile fleets sank – the merchants can finally safely reach Griffonia and, in fact, international trade is starting to flourish once again. We could benefit from that and open our borders to trade... However, in that scenario, our fledgling industry would have to compete with much better-established foreign companies, perhaps, it would be better if we limited our imports to let our economy properly recover from years of war and chaos?"

arantiga_govern.016.d:0 "As our conquests progressed, dealing with increasing numbers of prisoners of war was becoming harder and harder. Captured officials, nobles, republicans and many other people filled our labour camps to the brim. Some of them were conscripted into penal battalions and perished on various battlefields, but there is still a huge amount of prisoners who are being held in various work camps. As the influx of them became smaller in recent times, our administration finally managed to dedicate time to properly check what the prisoners, who are still alive, we're holding captive for. Apparently, a lot of them are working away in labor camps for very minor crimes, some were convicted by mistake during wartime chaos, and the most rabid enemies of the state have already been executed. Perhaps, we could offer a "fresh start" to everyone, who does not seem to be a threat – of course we can be more picky and free only those, who are for sure properly reeducated, and those, who fell victim to overzealous protectors of the Empire."

Thanks to the might of Arantigan legions, we conquered Griffonia, griffons come back to their normal life, they start to forget about war, and so we're facing a risk of dissent. We purged the Empire of most troublemakers, but we are not closed nation – creatures, goods, and worst of all, ideas travel. Of course we wil lemploy education and propaganda to ensure that griffons remain firm supporters of our divine emperor - however, we will always have to confront foreign republican and communist preachers with their media. They smuggle revolutionary literature, like the equestrian "Friendship Journal" or Caramel Marks' works on communist theory, into our country. Although many of these books are forbidden be printed, sold, and owned in The Empire, we are starting to face organised attempts to sow dissent by immigrants and governments hostile to The Empire. Therefore, it is necessary to create The Ministry of Information, that will properly censor foreign works, decide what can be published in Empire and supress foreign attempts to undermine our regime. This will not eliminate the problem entirely, but we will gain some degree of control. But there is another option, we could implement a more radical solution – eliminate all non state-owned media and forbid publishment of all foreign works, except for those, approved by The Ministry."

Effectively, every citizen was a soldier – either fighting on the front, or working for it. Now, the great goal had been achieved – Griffonia was united under the rule of Arantigos the Second, who has already surpassed both his great ancestor and the Grovers. Griffons or Arantiga deserve to enjoy the fruits of their victory. Removing most burdensome policies and demobilizing the economy will earn the Emperor gratitude of his subjects and let Arantiga move into a new golden age of prosperity... But we are still surrounded by many hostile states, therefore, staying prepared for new possible conflicts at least for a few more years would ensure our safety..."

arantiga_govern.019.d:0 "There were many ancient ruins on the arantigan hills. Some of these structures were built even before the days of Arantigos the First. Although merciless time and scavenging masons turned most of them into shapeless piles of rubble, those, still surviving, got turned into monuments by the order of Dorotheos. All, except one – the old temple of Boreas in the middle of a vast forest has never been visited by tourists or archeologists. Officially it stood on the land of a royal hunting reserve, restricted only to Dorotheos. He has never visited it until now. When he and Margareth were both children, they used to play in this forest, pretending to be heroes of old stories... These were good memories. And this temple would be a good place for eternal rest. In the old necropolis, surrounding the temple, there was one new gravestone – no name on it, only a coat of arms of house Featherin. After inspecting the old temple, Dorotheos understood why his sister had wanted to be buried here. It was... peaceful.\nThe old griffon sat on one of the crumbling monuments, listening to singing birds. He has never visited Margareth’s grave before... but now, when decades passed, and the fire, that had once burned in his soul, started to fade, it felt like the right time to visit her.\nHe recalled old memories of his childhood, days when he was happy, when he was thinking about the greatness, he wanted to achieve, when the future seemed bright. He had stopped being the "young conqueror" long ago, and now he felt empty... Millions feared him, tens of millions worshipped him. In every town there was at least one monument to Arantigos the Second, in every temple griffons prayed to portraits of him. There was no greater conqueror and probably there will never be one. Griffonia was in peace, memories of wartime atrocities were fading. But when Dorotheos closed his eyes, he could see burning cities, hear screams of dying griffons. An entire generation of arantigans died to fulfill his ambitions. His old comrades were dead – replaced by sycophants and modern technocrats. This was his legacy, an empire that his descendants would inherit, an empire built on a foundation of death and suffering.\nNever again has Arantigos the Great spoken to him, and as years passed, Dorotheos started to have second thoughts. He feared death, when he would have to face the gods – will he be welcomed among them, or treated as an usurper? He gave one last look to the gravestone and recalled his sister's last words, "Was it worth it?" After all these years..."

"Establish formal relations between The Riverlands and The Arantigan Empire to usher in a new age of peace and prosperity for both nations". Considering his reputation of an unstable madgriff, a merciless conqueror, and a city-destroying barbarian, expecting pigs to learn to fly was more reasonable than expecting him to propose us this! Yet, he actually did it. Many suspect that this is a part of an elaborate plan to invade us, but what if this is a legitimate proposition of lasting peace?"

Dorotheos was the first griffon, who overpowered them. When his legions marched east, Lake City, Rijekograd, and even the proud city of Nimbusia were taken from the ponies, the whole continent is now united under the rule of Arantigos the Second. The time to celebrate has not come yet though – the eastern ponies are a stubborn bunch and they are not going to surrender this easily. Titoist partisans are attacking our patrols in the countryside, and remnants of riverpony armies are waging guerilla warfare. It may take years before we eradicate resistance and firmly establish our rule over the East. Some businessgriffs are already planning on exploiting untapped resources of the newly acquired eastern lands, but it may be more costly than beneficial. Instead of having to constantly suppress riverpony nationalism and deal with greedy investors, it could be easier to give ponies autonomy within The Arantigan Empire, delegating the burden of dealing with all this mess to the local government."

Now however, when the equestrian influence waned, we easily conquered New Mareland and eliminateed the potential threat of pony invasion. It is time to decide the fate of ponies. The simplest option is full annexation – there is plenty of local griffons who are more than happy to get rid of pony dominance and can help us govern this area. But this will probably cause significant immigration of ponies into our other domains and spread of their ideology of harmony. To keep them more under control, we could create an autonomous state, ruled by local griffons, and let them deal with this issue.

King Dorotheos proposes an alliance between our nations, promising us glory and a chance to reconquer our rightful lands from Wingbardian claws. The army of Arantiga is without doubt a powerful force and with their support we should be more than able to rival Wingbardy, but Dorotheos could be an unreliable ally – he has already betrayed the previous ruler of Arantiga, his own sister, and his sanity is questionable – recently he proclaimed himself Arantigos reincarnated.

The king had a chance to meet Gesse a few years before, during joint Karthin Pact maneuvers and was quite impressed by his skills, and for a short time they exchanged letters, discussing matters of military strategy. Gesse claimed that he is willing to swear fealty to Arantigos and recognise him as the new ruler of Wingbardy. In fact, many griffons would be willing to work for us, and Gesse can clawpick some talented officers that can be convinced to join the arantigan cause. For sure many common soldiers will be willing to leave the work camps to fight for their new ruler. As we conquer more and more lands, we will be forced to rely on auxiliary forces, recruited outside of our homeland. But currently many officers oppose the idea of letting a former Wingbardian general fight for us and doubt if he can be trusted – accepting his proposition will put a strain on relations with our military..."

arantiga.085.d:0 "Entering Dorotheos' office felt relieving. Its humble appearance greatly contrasted grandiose decorations of the rest of the palace, really the only thing reminding about the high status of its owner was a large marble bust of Arantigos the Great. His descendant was sitting behind a sizeable desk made of carved wood. Beside him stood two guards, tracking every move of Nicolas, they were ready to kill him if he started threatening their ruler. \n\n   "Nicolas de Charbon, we presume?" Said Dorotheos and without waiting for response added, "You were on the list of Flowenians meant to be captured and placed in high security prisons, as potentially dangerous members of the old government. We were surprised when you turned yourself in willingly and requested an audience. So... Why?"\n\n   "It became obvious that sooner or later i would face the choice of either leaving Griffonia or getting captured. None of the choices suit me. I had some time to rethink past events, analyse recent military campaigns of Arantigan Legions, and I realised that Your Grace's victory is imminent".\n\nArantigos smiled slightly, but his eyes remained cold. There was something wrong with his eyes... They reminded Nicolas of those mad bishops, who preached their intepretations of holy texts, wholeheartedly believing in their every word – these were the eyes of a fanatic, totally invested in his cause.\n\n   "Go on". Said the white-feathered griffon.\n\n   "It is obvious that within the next few months, at worst a couple years, the rest of Griffonia will be conquered. I’m interested in finding my own place in this new reality – as Your Grace’s subordinate".\n\n   "And why would We accept a griffon who fought against us into our service? There are more than enough loyal Arantigans and foreigners, who have assisted us before".\n\n   "That’s simple. As you go along, it will become harder and harder to find competent griffons, Arantigos. The more lands you will conquer, the harder it will become for gifted griffons to get into your court. There are many conquests to come, for them you need experienced generals and governors, not some unfeathered fledgelings. And I assure you, that if given a chance I’ll prove myself useful for you".\n\nArantigos leaned back on his chair. According to the intelligence report, de Charbon could indeed be considered a talented commander, and a ruthless one. He needed such griffons. But the high command would surely be displeased with the news about a "cowardly flowenan" entering their ranks. And, more importantly – could he trust Nicolas?"

Numerous rebel cells have already risen and are now plotting against us. Their terrorist attacks are occurring on an almost daily basis. We need to deal with Aquileian resistance, if we hope to maintain control. The simplest solution would be to crush and supress them with the use of our armed forces – large-scale military action and arresting all known and suspected republican supporters may eventually break the rebels. But some within our intelligence suggest a more careful approach – they can infiltrate the republican movement, turning them against each other and then getting rid of those who remain."

Even though many considered their new ruler no more than a foreign warlord, their curiosity was strong. Without any doubt, this was the day, that would be remembered for many decades – the day, when a new empire was created. The ceremony started in the Temple of Boreas (now Temple of Arantigos-Boreas), where Dorotheos took an imperial crown from the claws of the newly appointed archon and crowned himself. The coronation ceremony was followed by a military parade. Military standards of defeated armies were carried along the symbols of the new empire, and veterans of countless campaigns marched through the streets. When Dorotheos finally arrived to the Imperial Palace, high-ranking officers, government officials, various nobles, and priests all knelt before him and swore fealty to their divine emperor. For the first time in many years Dorotheos smiled in delight. All these years of war, all these sacrifices... And now here, in the palace, he stood, having surpassed his great ancestor. He looked at griffons, all bowing to him, some from respect, others – from fear, and said: \n\n “For generation chaos reigned in Griffonia. For generations false kings and decadent emperors ruled over griffons. Gods turned away from us. These were dark days... But today a new era begins. No longer shall griffons bend to foreigners, no longer shall we be divided. With rebirth of Arantigos, Griffonia will be reborn too reforged with blood and steel, cleansed with fires of war.

Nothing was in vain, because now Arantigos rules the greatest country on Griffonia... Or at least tries do it. During years of expansion our bureaucracy was becoming more and more inefficient and finally its problems have reached critical mass and the central government is no longer able to properly deal with outer provinces. Luckily, the might of Arantigan Legions prevents open rebellion, but the fact is, we cannot properly govern all these lands, inhabited by numerous griffons of various nationalities and religions. The threat of revolution is once again looming on the horizon, our military governors act like barbaric warlords and our lack unity is starting to backfire. If we want The Empire to survive, it will be crucial to address multiple dire issues – and do it fast, before our numerous enemies come together and attack us!"

Since this cursed wedding he has been feling like everything he had fought for was slowly crumbling, and Aquileia, the nation he was almost devout to, was nothing more than a puppet in the claws of this... "Arantigos". For most nobles Dorotheos seemed just an ambitious upstart, an eastern warlord they can play with and fool with promises of power and prestige that came with a royal marriage. The queen and her lackeys believed in the sweet words of Arantigan diplomats too easily, ignoring even the obvious fact that Dorotheos was clearly a megalomaniac madgriff – they believed that this whole "godhood" thing was just a fool's play for common griffons. But Charles knew better, he had carefully studied intelligence reports about Featherin's campaigns and knew, that his enemy was a cunning strategist. Aquileia was his next target. There were some disturbing signs of that. Clearly Arantigan agents were trying to infiltrate the Aquileian command structure with the help of blackmail and bribes. Marechal has been gathering evidence for some time and now he was ready to unveil the plot meant to destroy his beloved Aquileia... He only needed to ask for a meeting with the queen and then...\n\n...No one has ever found out what would happen then. Unfortunately this day Greifenwald's office exploded – and the commander-in-chief of Armee de Aquilea died in an "act of terrorism conducted by a republican cell". The investigation was rather messy, but griffons that were hired to organise the assassination were professionals, who left no evidence of Arantigan involvement."

Population, long brutalised by Ferdinand’s soldiers, forgot for a moment that in fact not much has changed in their situation – it was just another oppressor, who was ruling them now. When the former dictator of the Griffonian Empire was brought to the gallows, crowds screamed and cursed him, and when he was finally executed, griffons started to celebrate. As Dorotheos watched cheering griffons from his tribune he recalled events of the last days. It was really hard to capture Dawnclaw – as he probably intended to die in combat, however soldiers were specifically instructed to capture him alive. When in prison, the Lord Protector seemed indifferent to what was happening around him – as if all of his will to live and ambition that was driving him were gone. When Dorotheos showed up, to thank him for “the last favor”, Dawnclaw unknowingly had done for him, the general just slightly grinned and said: “I must say it is actually a good plan. I will book you a place in hell.” As Featherin watched the execution, he was thinking about proclamations that would follow this day – “Dorotheos avenged the last Grover, saving the Empire from madgriff's claws”...It is good to have a scapegoat to hide your crimes – and Ferdinand was a perfect one."

"The poison is indistinguishable even for the best of physicians. The victim will appear to have died of an unexpected illness. Now, what about the payment?" Dorotheos raised his claw, "Yes, Yes, approximately one million idols, as agreed upon. paid in precious minerals, gems, and crystals as requested. Is it safer than cash?" The Zebra simply smiled. "Nowadays governments rise and fall, currencies are shaky! But gems are eternal". \n\n When the alchemist departed, Dorotheos once again looked at the vial lying upon his desk. He hired the zebra poisoner famous in the criminal underground for his extraordinary skills. Or so he thought. But he didn't doubt that the striped death dealer had held up his part of the bargain, in his business one could be either honest or dead, deception was impossible. \n\n All was accounted for, unicorns had certain crystals, which could extinguish the life of those, who touched them in a few hours, the unwitting alchemist was paid with these crystals. The unicorn, they were purchased from, laid dead at the bottom of Lake Rumare. The only thing left was to start the last phase of the plan. \n\n The poison provided by the zebra induced the same symptoms as the Grey Fever, a disease taht has been pestering devastated Griffenheim since its subjugation, but it led to a much quicker death. A group of carefully chosen zealously loyal griffons would help spread the disease to develop it into a full-scale epidemic. After that Grover would be poisoned. Amidst the chaos, caused by the epidemic, the death of one noble chick wouldn't seem strange, but to further cover up our involvement, after the end of their mission, our agents would be sent to the most dangerous places on the frontline, where they would perish and take the secret to the grave. \n\n King Arantigos recalled his meeting with the child-emperor. It happpened soon after his armies secured the Imperial City, young Grover was scared. Who wouldn't be? Arantigos was by this point one of the most renowned conquerors – he had defeated The Griffonian Empire. He'd get worried if the young griff wasn't afraid of him. Though at that point the child had witnessed so much cruety and death, he could have gone mad. But Arantigos was impressed, when the young no-longer-heir stood before him, trying to look as calm and presentable as possible. This must have been the worst day in his life. \n\n  For a brief moment Dorotheos wavered. But he knew – there can be only one Emperor."

arantiga.100.d:0 "Often named the city of Griffonia's desire for its prestige, size and magnificence, The Imperial City was the ultimate symbol of power. Even in defeat it looked imposing. Barely a month passed after the last enemy regiment in the city had surrendered. And now Griffenheim’s citizens were starting the hard work of rebuilding their damaged homes and neighborhoods. Slowly but surely the city would be rebuilt. \n\n Today, however, was not the day for rebuilding. Dorotheos, Arantigos reborn, decreed that on this day all citizens of the ruined city must attend the grand sparlean Triumph, a traditional ceremony reinstated, it signified a conqueror taking authority over his new lands. \n\n Small Arantigan flags flew in the slight breeze, tied to the black lampposts of the city. The Triumph took its route from Romau Plaza, along the Griffking Boulevard, wide as the river it was named after, to end at Zentralplatz near the Imperial Palace. Bridges over the Griffking River, destroyed by the defenders of Griffenheim, were a sad sight to behold, making Dorotheos’ glorious appearance look grotesque. \n\n As Dorotheos’ car passed through the streets, citizens of the city were waving flags and cheering. Many were forced to do so. Outside this display, most griffons looked sullen and defeated, resigned to their fate. They were only hoping that their lives wouldn’t change for the worse under their new ruler."

A short letter signed by none other than archon Erion XII. Initially Dorotheos suspected that message must have been an elaborate trap and immediately ordered to check it for any possible magical curses and more mundane means to kill him like poisonous chemicals. Thorough research revealed that the letter was not dangerous in any way. It’s contents however were interesting... The archon congratulated Arantigos with his recent victories and suggested that he would be willing to cooperate with the new ruler of Herzland and continue his work as the archon of Eyr helping to cement Dorotheos' rule. It is obvious that Erion just hopes to keep what little influence and wealth he has, but he is known as an extremely ambitious and untrustworthy griffon. Without doubt he is a shrewd politician and a legitimate archon. His support may prove valuable if we wish to be treated as more than just conquerors. But we will have to keep an eye on him."

When Arantigan Legions approached Karthin, morale was high and a fierce attack on the city began. Arantigan officers weren't concerned with losses of either side, neither did they care about the damage done to the city. Arantigos promised the highest decoration – The Order of Two Swords – to anyone, no matter the rank, who would manage to hang the arantigan flag from the top of Talonuels' palace. This led to a race between several units, which went deep into the city and headed straight for the royal palace, facing harsh resistance from its defenders. The race was won by the squad of sergeant Eigoros, with him and his junior sergeant Kantaros attaching the arantigan flag to the face of the building. Arantigos personally decorated the two and their commanding officer and offered them to join his personal guard. Soon after it, the last defenders of the city were defeated and the city surrendered in that, avoiding further damage. While most civilian districts were left in a moderately good shape, arantigan soldiers, following the orders of their ruler, demolished all symbols of the Wingbardian Kingdom. Statues of kings were broken, palaces cleared of all portraits and other items, representative of the former regime."

However resistance proved to be more severe than we expected, and many building quarters were demolished in brutal urban combat or destroyed by artillery barrage.

For several days locals were getting robbed of their possessions, before gendarmerie managed to suppress these groups of deserters. Units that maintained discipline were dispatched to protect aquilan landmarks, especially the temples of Trinity Hill.

They were supposed to discuss matters of military cooperation between Arantigan Legions and the Aquileian Royal Army. In reality, the discussion was more of a list of demands, and Greifenwald-Strawberry barely controlled himself not to order this eastern upstart to be thrown out of his office. It didn't take long before Arantigans started to treat Aquileia as their own backyard – various "diplomats" and "advisors" were almost openly interfering in internal Aquileian politics, and the royal government was being easily manipulated. Apparently, lured by promises of power and reign over Griffonia they followed this "Arantigos" helping him in his mad conquest of Griffonia. They foolishly believe that they are those who are playing him fool, instead, they are getting slowly entangled in a web of bribes, blackmail, and intrigue. If something would not be no later than in the following months, Aquileia would be free only in name. Something had to be done. Greifenwald needed to act. High ranking officers will follow him, and then overthrowing the queen would not be hard.

Officials of the deposed regime, including queen Vivienne, that avoided arrest, have already arrived in Arantiga, but now are virtually powerless.

arantiga.122.t:0 "The Last Deal"
arantiga.122.d:0 "The palace in Sparleto had one thing in common with flowenan residences – an expansive garden. Whoever designed this typical south griffonian building clearly loved vast courtyards and gardens, where its inhabitants could rest during the hottest hours of the day. Now it was occupied by visitors, who had to spend countless hours, waiting for an audience. But it was impossible for Nicolas to relax here – although everything seemed peaceful, he couldn't escape the eyes of many guards, monitoring the place for suspicious activity. Gardeners and servants seemed a bit too curious, they clearly were also a part of the internal security. What a crazy place... But being paranoid probably was justified for the owner, especially considering rumors of a recent coup attempt. During the next couple of hours Nicolas was notified several times that the king would talk to him shortly... But the invitation itself was not coming. Bored, he turned his attention to a fresco, that appeared to have been recently added to one of the walls. It depicted Dorotheos or, as he wanted to be called now, "Arantigos" as a lawgiver in fashion, typical to paintings of Boreas. Judging by this piece, the artist, who painted it, was quite decent, but Nicolas wondered if it was their own idea to glorify the ruler, or "Arantigos" himself requested to be depicted in this half-grandiose, half-heretical way. This wasn’t the only manifestation of the king's vanity he saw inside the palace alongside relics and works of art, clearly brought here as trophies from conquered nations. \n\nMore time passed, Nicolas was growing more and more irritated, deep in his thoughts he reminded himself why he was here – Flowena has fallen, and arantigan legions were marching through the West. Arantigos was carving his way to the ultimate victory, but Nicolas was sure, that even he beat all his enemies, his empire would not outlive him. Built on blood and fear, fueled by conquests, it would collapse right after its creator died, be it from claws of assassins, in another war, or due to old age... And then Flowena would be ready to rise once again. Perhaps de Charbons – Nicolas himself or his children – would lead his beloved city into the future. But for that to be possible, he needed to become a powerful griffon within Arantigos' realm – someone able to protect Flowena from dangers of this new age. This was why he had to clench his claws, bow to this wanna-be god, and serve him... \nSuddenly, he was pulled out of his thoughts by one of the servants,"
arantiga.122.a:0 ""His Majesty is waiting, please come with me.""
arantiga.149.t:0 "Personal Evaluation"
arantiga.149.d:0 "It was painfully obvious that Sparleos, the capital city of Arantiga was not nearly as rich as Karthin, or even Talononte. It would have forever stayed a backwater city, its old glory gradually withering away... If it were not for Dorotheos. The city might be small, but Fetivola could feel that soon enough it would become the beating heart of a new, sprawling empire, a new empire of Arantigans. He heard griffons speaking the old language on the streets, he passed by restored temples of Arantigos-Boreas and newly constructed monuments commemorating recent conquests... But all this was not important compared to the way local griffons carried themselves. The Talousian sensed a feeling of pride and common cause that unified citizens of Sparleos – faith that a great, new age would come and readiness to make it theirs. Once again, like centuries prior, griffons of Sparleos were ready to claim their destiny, and when they did so last time – whole Griffonia trembled in fear.\n\nThe king awaited him in the gardens of his palace – a greatly expanded traditional residence of the barons of Arantiga. Dorotheos sat on one of the benches near an elaborate fountain, apparently lost in thoughts. To Fetivola, this place seemed oddly... familiar. As if he had seen it once before. The setting of benches, flowers, and trees... This was more than a simple piece of gardening art. The guard that was guiding Fetivola cleared his throat trying to get the attention of the king, “My lord, mister Amilcare Fetivola has arrived, and as soon as we could, as you had requested, we brought him here.” Dorotheos nodded slightly, “Good... Now leave us.” he said to the guard. Without a word, the soldier left the garden. \n\n“It is not easy to achieve perfection. We believe that it is not possible in this earthly realm, that all we can do is to achieve an imitation of what lies beyond – a shadow of it. Take this garden for example: gardeners did all exactly as we ordered, as we remembered... And yet, we can feel that it is not fully right. Alas, this is the best that can be achieved. We shall do the same with Griffonia – though some griffons may never change, we will do all to make things right. We are glad to be able to finally meet you, mister Fetivola. We have read your manifesto, years ago. It was quite enlightening...”"

arantiga.150.t:0 "Talouse Defies Us!"
arantiga.150.d:0 "Fetivola, in his foolishness, has publicly proclaimed that our king is nothing more than an imposter and false Arantigos – and that only his own regency can lead to reclamation of the old glory of the Sparlean kingdom. We have no other way that to deal with him other than using brute force."
arantiga.150.a:0 "Prepare tanks!"
arantiga.151.t:0 "Matters of Destiny"
arantiga.151.d:0 "“Thank you.” Amilcare smiled slightly, “Destiny is a funny thing... It is inevitable, yet it needs some help to be achieved, some inspiration.”\n\n“Precisely.” responded Dorotheos, “Claiming one’s destiny requires strength. One has to push through even if all odds are stacked against him... Our goal is the same, mister Fetivola, our destiny is shared. Talonsia was once the Warden of the South, and its ruler – the staunchest follower of our great forefather – the first Arantigos. Once more it could be like this, but the road ahead will be difficult – Talonsia, just like Arantiga, will have to give all it can to restore our great past, and later, to surpass it.”\n\nAmilcare saw irony in this, “That's the most unusual way of swaying an ally – not promising riches or power, but saying that he has to practically sacrifice himself.” \n\n“The former offer would offend a griffon like you, mister Fetivola.” Arantigos laughed, “No, I don’t need griffons I can bribe – there are dozens of such miserable creatures, and I already have to deal with them every day. I need a true believer in the Arantigan cause. A follower, not a servant. A champion, not a mercenary. I have deep personal respect for you, mister Fetivola, you are a true scholar from the old ages. I believe, we have a lot in common... If you are to refuse my offer, I will let you leave my kingdom unharmed, and next time we will face each other on the battlefield.”\n\nFetivola stood in silence. He had to think: Was Dorotheos truly the reborn Arantigos? He had reclaimed the Idol, but clearly could not command it... But Arantigos the Great was just a griffon. Clearly, Arantigos Reborn would be a much greater being by nature. Would he need the Idol’s powers at all? Amilcare felt relieved, then reinvigorated. He has always known his own destiny – to restore Talonsia’s honour, but Talonsia’s destiny had been to serve its only true master – Arantigos. The determination and iron will of the young king were overpowering, Amilcare didn’t doubt that he would succeed on his quest. Yet, even the greatest conqueror could use help. Perhaps, this was the way he had to fulfill his destiny..."

Dorotheos Featherin, or, as he’s taken to calling himself, “Emperor Arantigos the Second”, a self-proclaimed god, somehow managed to conquer the entirety of the crumbled Griffonian Empire, and establish himself as the ruler of Griffonkind. Now he turned his eyes towards us and demanded we surrender our colony of New Mareland, which Arantiga deems to be a “national security hazard”. If we refuse, Arantigans swear to press their claim by force.

If we transfer Colthage to Arantiga, which they consider “their rightful claim through the ancient feud of their ancestors”, Arantiga will provide us with a huge sum of money, and offer us a place at their side as their allies and equals. While many suggest this offer is an insult to our national pride, this way vile Colthaginians would become someone else’s problem to deal with, and we will avoid a conflict with a continent-sized superpower.

arantiga.126.t:0 "Reining in Colthage"
arantiga.126.d:0 "It was a long and unpleasant day. Through years of conquests and governing an evergrowing Empire, Dorotheos became used to dealing with self-serving and often incompetent traitors better known as “collaborators”. Usually however, their numbers were pretty limited – especially when it came to high-profile celebrities. Sometimes Arantigan agents had to go actively looking for griffons willing to do their dirty work... This was not the case in Colthage.\nEver since the plans to form an autonomous Colthaginian administration were uncovered, a neverending stream of letters has started coming to His Majesty’s office – each new one more flattering than the previous. The strings of grandiose titles given to Arantigos in these letters exceeded even the sermons of the Imperial Temple. And what was worse, not all Zebras were content with just using letters. There was actually a rather sizeable group of applicants who had somehow wormed their way into the palace, bribing officials to get an opportunity to present their candidacy to the Emperor himself. Arantigos had the displeasure of talking with only a few of them – and all of these meetings were so painfully alike that only the first one stood out to him: it was a moustached (why, apparently ALL Colthaginians had moustaches), smug-looking aging Zebra, who, in heavily accented Wingbardian, described in exhaustive detail his extensive experience in governing difficult regions of Eastern Colthage, his borderline intimate ties to the landowning elite, his military experience and his deep adoration of Emperor Arantigos and “his glorious conquests”, reasoning that all this would make him a perfect governor for Colthage. The entire conversation left Dorotheos with the unmistakable foul aftertaste only talking to someone completely lacking any beliefs and affiliations could leave – a true political chameleon.\nYet, a choice had to be made. After a few more days a small pile of dossiers with most prospective candidates to govern Colthage was delivered by a HIMSS liaison. The first entry was doubly surprising: it was that Colthaginian Dorotheos had talked to – apparently he actually did have varied and extensive experience in both civil service and the military, what’s more, neither his first name, – Benoam – nor his second name – Gerza – started with a “Z” – which was another constant Arantigos noticed among his new striped subjects.  Arantigos skimmed through the other dossiers: Hiram Z-something, diplomat; Jebzel Z-something, army general; Bezelshazzar Z-something, alcoholic. The last file humoured the emperor: two Z-s in one person – Zaron Zorrel, a middling politician. His head buzzing, Arantigos took a deep breath and let his gaze shift to the Colthaginian war map. A name sparked in his head. General Craterus. He used to be a mercenary in Zebrica and always fondly spoke of his time in Colthage. Though he might still be needed at home, wouldn’t ruling Colthage be the reward he always wanted?"
arantiga.126.a:0 "Choose the 'Z-less' Zebra."
arantiga.126.b:0 "Let's go double-Z!"
arantiga.126.c:0 "Craterus deserves a treat."
arantiga.127.t:0 "Just Good Business"
arantiga.127.d:0 "“I truly hope, gentlegriffs, that this day will be the beginning of a new chapter in history of both our nations. Hippogriffia and Griffonia always shared many similarities, and only now, under Arantigan protection we can finally work together to deepen the ties between our races. Aris shall soon become a pearl in the crown of Arantigan holdings in Zebrica, and I assure you: Hippogriffs will be the most trusted subjects of Emperor Arantigos. May the Eternal Sun forever shine over the Mountain!” – Moonfeather concluded a rather lengthy speech. Satisfied grins came over the faces of Arantigan officers assigned to his entourage for protection. And for a good reason – in exchange for a rather hefty sum, the ghostwriter did well, producing perhaps the most lengthy eulogy to Arantiga and her emperor. During the applause, Moonfeather spotted something amusing: the most active support for his speech in fact came from ex-Wingbardian officers, apparently trying to make up for their late joining to the Arantigan cause with extra zeal. Nevertheless, many of them have previously received sizable bribes, and so did certain high-ranking griffons within the Imperial Treasury. When Aris Protectorate was being established, Moonfeather quickly offered his assistance to the nascent government, which earned him the gratitude of a quite few overworked bureaucrats. It was to be expected that news of his contribution quickly reached Griffonia, and after a formal presentation to the Emperor he was swiftly appointed as Protector. Things were porceeding smoothly, and Moonfeather expected that his companies would soon receive permissions to operate on Griffonian soil – and with the seemingly unbound potential of Aris, he would soon take a cozy position in the new world order. Moonfeather was none the wiser as to how long this absurd realm of a self-proclaimed god would last, but he knew that no matter what happened..."

arantiga_decision.50.t:0 "Secrets of the Pentarchy"
arantiga_decision.50.d:0 "The county of Barrad had been until recently ruled by its five half-mad, half-genius sorcerous overlords. Ever since the beginning of their reign, Barrad became a cursed land, plagued by magical disasters, unnatural and destructive weather, runaway experiments and occasional battles between adventurers and the ruling mages or among those mages themselves. In the end, the so-called “Pentarchy” had successfully eradicated most of its own members through infighting, and then whatever remained of their madness was hopefully swept away by the Arantigan garrison. Now, Barrad stands broken and desolate on the outskirts of our Empire, the one province we prefer would not exist. Yet, it holds some secrets to uncover. Rumors speak of automatons mimicking griffon life, spells of power rivaling even the greatest feats of unicorn magic, machines capable of reshaping reality or opening ways to the worlds beyond our own. While many of these are probably just overblown hearsay, there must be a grain of truth in some of them. Undoubtedly, whatever can be recovered within the lands of Barrad, can be turned to serve Arantiga and further Griffon scientific progress."
arantiga_decision.50.a:0 "Send the expedition!"
arantiga_decision.51.t:0 "Studying What Remains"
arantiga_decision.51.d:0 "Enrico came to wonder why he agreed to join the expedition once again. His laboratory in Karthin was warm, cozy and spacious. There was even a nice restaurant just across the street that served the tastiest macaroni. All this he threw away because he felt bored by daily routine...\nRight then, warm memories of Wingbardy got swept away by a sudden blow of unnaturally strong wind. The weather in Barrad was beyond unpleasant: unpredictable, extreme, seemingly bent on making the researchers’ lives pure suffering. Enrico instinctively raised the side of his cloak. He stood at the entrance to what once was an extremely out-of-place zebra temple, decorated in a manner which can only be called deranged, now stood completely ruined, despite being abandoned for just a few years. It seemed as if nature itself tried to erase this unholy building from existence. Most of the artifacts and scriptures remaining inside were incomprehensible to griffons. Luckily, they’d managed to hire Joao, a zebra magic specialist from Kasa. However, with each new uncovered room of the temple, the zebra, chatty and friendly at first, became more and more moody, spending hours studying writings on the walls, explaining very little and saying that “he needs more time to put it all together into a whole picture”.\nEnrico sighed quietly and went inside again. Most of his team was busy securing various alchemical artifacts scattered across already cleared rooms. They would surely prove useful in researching secrets of zebra magic. Joao was however nowhere to be seen. A quick inquiry revealed that he’d gone deeper into the temple, to check on the doors they had not managed to open yet. Feeling bored, Enrico decided to follow him. To his surprise, huge metal doors, covered with symbols in one of zebra languages, were... open. Inside there was something which resembled an altar, shelves full of books and scrolls – and Joao – at the chamber’s centre, pouring some liquid from a huge canister... The smell was a dead giveaway – it was fuel.\n“Wait!” screamed Enrico, “What are you doing?!”\n“Protecting all of you.” responded the zebra calmly, “Osvananga cannot be released! Ever since I first found a mention of this name, I knew what had to be done.”\n“What are you talking about? What is Osvananga? What is this place?”\n“Better to not know. Some knowledge can be a curse.” saying this, the zebra poured the remaining fuel on himself. Enrico rushed forward, but before he could do anything, the crazy Kasan dropped a small bottle on the ground. In an instant, the whole chamber caught on fire. The zebra let out a horrific to scream, dying a horrible death – and after a few moments, collapsed on the floor, his body melting unnaturally fast. Enrico ran away, calling for help, but the team had no way of stopping the fire which started spreading to other rooms of the temple.

arantiga_decision.52.d:0 "Project Revival — Summary Report\nResearch teams have concluded a survey of the remaining magical facilities across Barrad. Most of them were heavily damaged, both during fights across the region, and by local weather phenomena. We have also detected several attempts by the local population to assault these places, which they associate with their former overlords. Due to these events, recovered information is fragmented, and research materials are scarce. The most prospective object, a facility owned by a zebra mage known as “Asinti” has been destroyed by a rogue researcher. Despite these setbacks, the IRI has managed to recover data about three potentially useful achievements of the Barrad Magocracy: Transparent Metal, which would greatly improve our industrial capabilities, Concentration Bre, already requested for testing as stimulant by the military, and Eadburg’s Negative Air spell that could reduce maintenance cost of our equipment. Due to the severe lack of artifacts needed to complete the research and risk of destroying the few we possess during the reverse engineering process, we will be able to complete only one of these projects.\nDuring the survey we have also discovered the location of a certain “Reactor”. What little information we have suggests that the site holds a rudimentary, yet a fully functional magi-nuclear reactor. We must study it to find out how the Pentarchy managed to complete such a feat of engineering ahead of anyone in the world."

IRI researchers were being assisted by a substantial contingent of elite legionnaires, meant to ensure their safety. With Barrad being still a largely untamed region, griffons had to deal with both locals, and some more supernatural threats. The reactor was discovered quickly. While its location had long been deserted, it was still a fully functional magi-nuclear reactor... At least so it seemed initially. Researchers were amazed by the unusual design of the device, they called it marvelous, ahead of its time – it was a true wonder of magitech. However, there was a plethora of tests to be done on the reactor, before an attempt to bring it alive once more could be done.\nA lone griffon continued his writing. The sounds around and within him made it hard to focus. But this was important. He had to not forget. He had to write it all down.\n“It all started with these dreams, dreams no one could recount. Yet each morning we would wake up restless, with feelings of unease and dread. After a few days, memories of the dreams began staying with us – no matter how hard we tried to forget them. These were dreams of fear, treachery, and consumption by a greater power. Marco, Sergio, and Yannis disappeared, nowhere to be found. Next week, one of the guards cracked and opened fire on his mates – shooting himself soon after. In his final moments he screamed of ghastly voices in his head. Soon more of us started hearing them, and so did I. The guards wandered in total apathy, as if their minds were emptied. We put to work on the reactor. Our equipment proved useful. It let us repair it fully and reignite its heart. It is only those who truly listen to the Voices that can comprehend the greatness of what’s ahead. Soon, everyone will be made to hear, to listen, to understand.”\nThe griffon rested his claw in the pot of blood. It was good blood. He tried three other griffons and one pony before, but only this one had the right composition, proper texture. The voices were getting louder. The buzz was growing stronger."

Several mages around the area have however reported increased magical activity, noting it as ‘disturbing’. Following this, we lost contact with nearby garrisons. Next day, soldiers from said garrisons, accompanied by huge crowds of local peasantry stormed our main military base in the region, ignoring wounds sustained in the fighting. The base was lost, as was its garrison, and we were forced to completely withdraw from the region. We are currently assessing the nature of the threat and mobilising local legions to contain it."

arantiga_decision.55.d:0 "We are facing what seems to be a full-blown magical disaster. Our experts are convinced that the enemy force in Barrad is under some form of mind control, and they have failed to find a remedy for it. The area affected by mass hypnosis is slowly expanding, encompassing several large towns and villages. At the epicentre of the area stands the magi-nuclear reactor, which we presume to be the cause of the spell. As far as we know, tens of thousands of locals may soon advance on neighbouring regions. Several garrison brigades of the Imperial Legions have been routed or outright destroyed. Thralls, while impressively coordinated, seem to have limited understanding of modern military strategy and have access to weapons scavenged from destroyed military units, which under normal circumstances would guarantee us a quick victory. What lets them advance so quickly is, however, that the magical weather phenomena across the Barrad are growing in strength, greatly limiting our movement. Several areas have been completely devastated, with local infrastructure destroyed and population halved.\nAttempts to bomb the reactor facility have failed. While air recon was successful, harsh weather conditions led to the loss of many airplanes. A squadron of bombers managed to reach the target, but moments before the bombs hit the target, the reactor surrounded itself with some form of magical barrier, completely negating all damage.\nIn light of these events, general staff has prepared plans for operation Stiletto. An experimental warhead meant to punch through city-scale magical shields will be assembled and delivered to Barrad, while a large bomber plane will be reinforced to survive the flight. Until then, the legions will delay the advance of thralls."

According to the instruments, they were nearing the target.\n”Prepare the bomb!” Screamed the pilot. “ETA ten minutes!” Two other crew members made their way to the back of the plane where a single gigantic bomb rocked on its rack, as if eager to be let loose. Its enormous shell was covered with intricate magical symbols and spiky crystals, meant to disrupt energy fields, and let it pass through any sort of magical defence. Two griffons proceeded to methodically check both conventional and magical instruments.\n“Ready!” one of them shouted over the scream of engines, “Launching on command!”\nTen minutes passed. The reactor was right beneath them. The pilot opened his beak... And said nothing. His minds suddenly stripped of all thought – there was only the all-consuming Voice. The griffon shook his head. No. Nothing. Just an eerie feeling...\n“On target!”\nThe first bombardier pulled the lever. The bomb bay opened. The second one pushed the button, and the massive warhead started its long journey down...\nA few seconds later, the bomb pierced the protective shield, hitting the reactor facility. The explosion obliterated the entire structure. And then the secondary, much more powerful, magical explosion followed, digging out a massive hole where the reactor used to be and shaking the escaping bomber plane above. The explosion could be heard tens of miles away as thralls fell to the ground, twitching in pain and screaming, thee voices in their heads finally going silent."

We are hitting blocks in places we have never even predicted, and every solution we come up with seems to not work. There is no other way forward. Which means that the project has failed entirely."\n\nHeinrich looked blankly at Bright Glow, before the realisation hit him. "That...sucks. Arantigos certainly will certainly not be happy. Money, after all, does not grow on trees. You'd better make yourself scarce, my friend. Arantigos does not take lightly to failure."\n\nBright Glow nodded, "My and my colleagues have already prepared for this eventuality. We are to have disappeared by tomorrow."\n\n"Good, good. Knew you guys were always a smart lot. This may be last time we meet each other, so good luck on your journey, Bright Glow."\n\nThe pony and the griffon stood up, and Heinrich watched as Bright Glow disappeared into the corridor.

Thankfully, the resulting fire was quickly brought under control, and no more lives were lost. After Il Servizio Segreto secured the area, a rescue operation was undertaken, in an attempt to salvage anyone or anything that remained in the vast field of broken rubble. Initially, the operation's main goal was to simply recover as much research as possible, but as the salvagers got further into the the remains of the buildings, they began finding griffons and ponies who had, in fact, survived the explosion. After digging for at least two days, they unearthed the second-in-command of Gotterhammer, and a personal friend of Bright Glow, Antoine.\n\n"I...I do not know what really happened. I had been up working the whole night prior, so my head really ached." As if to prove his point, the griffon massaged his head. "I really do not remember much. But today was the day when Bright Glow would finally test his theory of liquified magical energy, and I do remember a lot of apprehension around my colleagues. Apparently they were worried about the impurities in the crystals, and how those impurities would increase the volatility of the whole reaction. Ugh...I was there too, but my head began aching a few moments before," he gestured to the ruins. "I excused myself, and one of the assistants took over my place. I went to the bathroom to splash some water on my face, and suddenly...I was buried under concrete."\n\nFrom the ruins, a sizable amount of research would be recovered, but with the Gotterhammer team - save for Antoine - dead, the project has been shut down."

Griffons were largely unable to fully utilise the their potential due to their limited magical abilities. However with our conquest of Aquileia, we also have gained a substantial number of talented pony scientists. With their help, we could push forward our own nuclear research program and hopefully create a magical-nuclear bomb - or nuclear bomb for short - long before our enemies will be able to. Of course, given our earlier status as a mere vassal to the Wingbardian king, our nuclear program is near non-existant, which means that we will have to utilise the has already been done by the countries that we have previously conquered.\n\nOf all the nuclear programs that Aquileia had been running, one in particular has grabbed our attention, because it is not developing a mainstream nuclear bomb, and because it has had the futhest progress out of all of them - not that there has been much progress. Lead by a prominent unicorn physicist from the University of Aquila, Bright Glow, their team proposes a rather unorthodox theory. Traditionally, scientists have theorised that such a bomb would be powered using magical crystals and uranium, with the uranium serving as a integral catalyst. Meanwhile, Bright Glow theorises that under the right conditions, the power contained within the crystals becomes fluid, and can be transfered as necessary, without the need for a complex megaspell framework or a potentially carcinogenic catalyst. This has lead to the project gaining immense interest from the Aquileian government, and now they will work on their project under ours."

When the Chief heard it, he understand why Bright Glow went to all the trouble to make sure it went to him directly; it was quite ridiculous. Apparently, the team at Gotterhammer has recently recieved test results that are widely disperersed. It apparently was caused by a rarely-documented aspect of magical transfer that only comes into effect in a very specific environment.\n\nBright Glow was certain that while a detailed explanation existed for such a mechanism, it did not exist in any griffon archives, and he was right. So he took on it himself to search for knowledge he needed, and after contacting colleagues across Griffonia, he was able to ascertain the existence of a book, and indeed, the exact page, that described, the phenomenon that had the Gotterhammer team stumped. The one problem: it was Equestrian property, and they still held strict restrictions on who was allowed to read such books. A few phone calls by the Chief had confirmed this, and it appeared that the only way to get this knowledge would be to steal it, as fanciful as it seems, is the only way to aquire such knowledge.

Wearing black overalls and carrying a lockpicking set, Albert flew up high to a window on the 45th floor of the castle, and began work on breaking and entering. What they hadn't counted on was the window being fully maintained, such was the efficiency of the Equestrian administration, and in the end Albert had to force his way in. The Library was helpfully color-coded and cross-referenced, and it took no time for Albert to find what he was looking for. He made for the window, but collided with a Royal Guard who had been awakened when Albert broke the glass window. Luckily, he was too sleepy to aim or spell properly, and Albert managed to knock him out after a 'brief' struggle.

To that extent, he has recommended a few crystals that are owned by a prominent Aquileian collector. He has approached the griffon personally, but he does not want to sell.

We always follow the most stringent safety routines, and I'd trust everyone at Gotterhammer with my life. But, the volatility of such a liquid bomb would negate the need for a complicated detonation mechanism, so that simplifies exploding it I guess. Anyways, now that we are moving to larger crystals with more magical power stored, I just thought it would be prudent to move research somewhere more...remote."\n\n"You have somewhere in mind? I hear the Scheisswald's perfect this time of year!" said Heinrich, chuckling.\n\nBright Glow, meanwhile, had a serious look on his face, "Exactly what I was thinking. It's remote, and already has extensive crystal mines, which would help logistics. Building some infrastructure there would really hurt would it? The remote location also ought to allay those 'security concerns' that those folks over at Il Servizio Segreto keep raising at our monthly meetings."\n\nNow that Bright Glow had explained his reasoning, the move to the Scheisswald does not seem as ridiculous as it had..."

This decision would turn out to save thousands of lives in our capital.\n\nBright Glow and his colleagues had severely underestimated instability of liquidified crystals. Soon after the crystals were prepped for the energy transfer, the magical control field surronding the crystals were overwhelmed by chaotic and uncontrollable magical energies. At least, that is what our investigators believe happened, after spending days combing through the prior reports made about project, and studying large crater that was left after the explosion that obliterated a substantial part of Scheiswald Forest and several nearby settlements. Apparently, the explosion only occured now, after months of experimentation, because the purity of the crystals played a big role in reducing volatility. But, in the end, even the most pure crystals in the world could not prevent the eventual explosion. The explosion was even reportedly heard in Griffenheim, where the population was not convinced by the hastily prepared explanation; that the incident was the result of the unleashing of an ancient spell by group of prospectors...Strangely enough, the area affected by liquid crystal explosion was soon covered in large quantity of crystals deposits.

The griffon stopped in front of the Chief, panting like a mad dog.\n\n"Ferrucio. What's the problem?" asked the Chief, expecting nothing but crazy theories of Maarite cults. He was proven right.\n\n"I saw him! I saw him at the Maarite march today, those damn Maarites."\n\nThe Chief was confused, "Who, and what Maarite march?"\n\n"There's one happening in the city center, and I was watching them to make sure they didn't cause trouble. Then, I saw him. One of the griffons at Panaceum, in the march, all dressed up, but I knew it was him nonetheless." The Chief frowned and waved off the liason. Ferrucio was one of his best griffons, but maybe Panaceum was the wrong project for him..."

arantiga_decision.25.d:0 "The police have been investigating a string of violent crimes, and have managed to connect the crimes to a prominent Maarite cult. Today, they conducted a raid on what was supposed to a be a small safehouse, but turned out the be the main gathering point of the secret organisation. The police were intially outnumbered when a gunfight broke out, but reinforcements arrived to finish the Maarites off. A few people died in the engagement, but most of the cultists have been apprehended.\n\nAll day, Ferrucio wore a mask of barely-concealed schadenfreude, as it turned that among the captured, were most of the team at Panaceum. They, like the others, have been arrested by the police, who have refused to release them, citing dangers to civilians and the state. The police claim the best course of action would be to conduct an investigation into the IRI, and many in the organisation also feel that this is the best course of action.\n\nNormally, Ferrucio would be at the front of encouraging harsh action on Maarites, but he has toned it down, and instead proposed releasing the Panaceum team and then keeping a very close eye on them. He says he is concerned with the other Maarites who have escaped the raid, and that the Panaceum research is still not complete. And although no one has suggested such an option, there is enough clout to just release the Panaceum team, without any hidden plans and such, although this would be very risky."

Zobrist had intended for this depopulation to be acheived through the use of a rapidly-spreading artificial virus.\n\nEarlier yesterday, the cultists rounded up at the raid escaped from custody, and potential Maarite sympathisers in the police administration were purged from its ranks. The escaped cultists fled to the Panaceum building, and kicked out everyone not associated with them. The police laid siege to the building, with the Inspector fearing a release of the bioweapon. Uncertainty dominated for fifteen hours before Ferrucio arrived. He gave the order to shell the factory with incendiary weapons, in a bid to wipe out any sort of virulent agent. The army brought in artillery, and after a day-long fire, it seems that the site was contained. The Maarites were wiped out, and any sort of biological agent was neutralised.

It seems that their efforst were not compromised by sympathisers in the police, and when they recieved word of the prison breakout, they immediately set into motion. Stealthily breaking into the building, they took what items they could before it was set alight.\n\nFerrucio was relieved that some information had escaped the fire, and he was relieved to read that the Maarite were still far from their proposed bioweapon. There was no threat after all. Despite Panaceum being a total dud, some of the Maarites' research has practical value, so not everything was wasted.\n\nSo many questions, but no answers..."

Guards searched his laboratory, the cafeteria, the park, his favorite bar, and his room with no success. They even searched trains and planes leaving the area and there was no sign of him. It appears that we have lost him forever. As for his experiments, no one dares to touch or even restart them, and care will be provided for his mangled test subjects.

However, unlike many, he was not a fraud or a scammer, and he was not a naive scientist with impossible ideas. Instead, he was an experienced professor with a project that had a strong theoretical foundation and a firm plan of action already outlined, which of course pleased our adminstrators.\n\nHis was one of the few that was sent directly to Arantigos himself, and now, he has the greenlight and the funding to begin. Almost immediately after the approval came through, a laboratory was hastily prepared and outfitted with the necessary equipment, all of which was ready in a few days. Allenstein himself was immediately flown in from Yale, and the work can finally start."

arantiga_decision.32.d:0 "After a few days of working under the IRI, Allenstein's performace is nothing short of exemplary. He has settled into his new laboratory without issue and our liason says he gets along with his assistants well, likely a habit picked up from Gamia. However, he has contacted Arantigos for an entirely different reason.\n\nIt was known that Allenstein's experiments were considered unethical so his request is not unexpected, especially given the nature of his project. However, it is only now that he has asked for griffon test subjects for his experiments. If the IRI were to get approval, there would be no trouble procuring them and the number he asks for is a rather small amount. Regardless, the final decision lies with Arantigos."

arantiga_decision.33.t:0 "Test Subjects Required!"
arantiga_decision.33.d:0 "We have again heard from the IRI liason, and he does not bring good news. It appears that Allenstein has severely underestimated the amount of test subjects he needs, to say the least. He has requested the IRI to provide a vast amount of such test subjects, a vast increase over what he had previously said. According to the liason, Allenstein has admitted his error, but it will be substantially more difficult to procure these test subjects because of the large amount Allesntein needs.\n\nThe IRI has already begun provisions to aquire these griffons, but the question is should we? There are rumors that his research has run into snags at his laboratory and for all we know it the whole research project might end up in failure."

arantiga_decision.34.t:0 "New Equipment Required!"
arantiga_decision.34.d:0 "It appears that Allenstein has suffered a major accident in his laboratory. Allenstein, his assistants, and his test subjects are unscathed, but a lot of his equipment was damaged beyond the point of repair. A lot of money has already been lost, and Allenstein says that he not only needs the destroyed equipment replaced, he also needs items that can only be imported at great cost from Equestria, such as prosthetics and high-quality magical crystals and serum. Not only is this his most expensive request to date, after that accident doubts have surfaced within the IRI of the project's viability."

arantiga_decision.35.t:0 "The Fruits of Labor"
arantiga_decision.35.d:0 "Allenstein's hands ached after hours at the operating table. It hadn't helped that he had sent his assistants out after the accident, he had no wish to endanger them more than what was needed. Nowadays they would simply bring Allenstein what he needed and got out. Sometimes he had regretted doing so, as it meant more work for him, especially during these operations.\n\nAfter he was finished installing every last serum pump, magical receptor, and node, he sewed up the subject and inspected his work. Allenstein was soaked up to his neck in blood, and his eyes and nose burnt from all the repulsive and poisonous chemicals needed in this operation. After taking a sip of water, his eyes began to rest on the subject. The brown griffon once known as Adalbert was no longer recognizable, his body a ravaged mess of feathers and ugly technology. Allenstein's eyes teared up at the though that Adalbert was gone; he was too young to die. Alas, there was nothing he could do. After thirty minutes of not breathing or moving, he surely was dead.\n\nAs was protocol, Allenstein reached to take the griffon's pulse, when Adalbert's claw suddenly grasped his outstrechted arm. His grip was so tight that Allenstein could only grimace in intense pain as his arm was broken. He barely heard Adalbert over his own screams. "Doc. Am I alright...?" Adelbert tried to speak before he collapsed from sheer effort . His grip on Allenstein loosened and he dropped to the floor with a thud, his blood pooling around him.\n\nLuckily, his assistants came in a few minutes later and hauled Allenstein to the infirmary. When he had recovered from the shock, he made sure Adalbert was okay before setting out towards the liason's office.\n\nHe managed to catch the liason, an agreeable griffon by the name of Holt, hurriedly leaving his apartment.\n\n"Allenstein," he cried. "You alright? What happened? I was going to come over to the hospital as soon as I heard but you're already here. What the hell?" the liason recoiled at the sight of Allenstein and his broken arm.\n\n"It works! My theory is correct! The operation was a success!" Allenstein explained.\n\n"It worked? That's great news! I assume you, uh, had an accident with the subject?" Allenstein nodded. "Well, the IRI is not going to like to hear about this, so we should get a demonstration prepped as soon as possible. How soon can you hold one?""

Getting used to them required often months of training. And when the Arantigan armies marched, countless soldiers, talented, loyal soldiers, were injured, many becoming crippled. These cripples in their droves volunteered for Allenstein’s experiments. They died at the hand of Allenstien's experiments. If there was a lack of volunteers, there was more than enough convicts, which either way would end up executed.\n\nBut finally, after months of work, the project was finished and Allenstein could present results. Arantigos was invited to watch maneuvers where groups of augmented veterans would fight his elite personal guard, the Companions. Each of Allenstein’s patients lacked at least one or more limb, and their crystal eyes glowed with baleful light, and alchemic implants pumped a mixture of stimulants when they charged the Companions. Arantigos and a small group of high-ranking officers were quite surprised when the Companions were quickly defeated, as the augmented soldiers easily crushed any resistance. Finally, Arantigos called for Allenstein with a gesture of his claw.\n\n"We must admit doctor, it is quite impressive. But the costs of single augmentation..." He grinned. "We have been told that you can build several tanks with that money."\n\n"Yes indeed. And I am afraid that solving this problem may take years if not decades to solve. So many different combination of crystal magic, enchantments and alchemy..."\n\n"We've read your reports; you do not need to explain the technicalities. Due to costs and limited amount of rare materials that are needed, we will never be able to field more than a few regiments of such soldiers. But a small, elite group of griffons will always have its uses. And our personal guard could also be replaced. Continue your research, doctor...""

Anyways, given the strange, fiercly meritocratic nature of Wittenland's aristocracy, and an impressive magical display, we are certain that he is competent magician. His theory has also been reviewed by Aquileian magicians, and they are confident that it will indeed work as intended.\n\nAs our realm expands, communication and transportation channels will become stretched, and Ascarius provides a simple solution to our troubles: teleportation. Of course, griffons will never be able to do more than simple enchantment, and only the most skillful of unicorns ever attempt teleportation. Instead, Ascarius proposes that a machine powered by magical crystals and bond by arcane science can transport griffons across great distances instantaneously.\n\nUnfortunately, us griffons will never have any idea what he is talking about..."

So of course the liason was immediately questioned about these emergency funds, and the answer we got was nothing short of ridiculous that laughter broke out amongst our administration. But, it seems that liason was being dead serious and our funds have indeed been wasted by an over-enthusiastic Ascarius...\n\nWeeks into Project Silver Key, it appears that Ascarius decided to host a party for his assistants to 'celebrate all they had done, and to take a well-earned rest'. While unusual, our liason did not pay the matter much attention, until he held another such party the next month. From every month, it became every fortnight until they were held almost everyday, and the amount of people attending was surely not getting smaller.\n\nIt appears that the funds provided for the project fell under Ascarius' own stipend, and that he has been able to siphon this money away for his parties.

It appears that his party last night, which was his biggest, spiralled out of control as creatures became intoxicated on the wildest variety of narcotics you could ever find. This is enough to warrant an arrest, but it appears that the revelers decided to go on the rampage and damage sections of town. As the host of the offending party, Ascarius was thrown in prison, and he faces trial tomorrow, where it is all but certain that he will be judged guilty. \n\nOn one hand, we could allow the trial to go ahead without interference, and he will be thrown in jail. What may turn into a embarresment to the government would have been disposed of, but his expertise and knowledge make him invaluable to Project Silver Key, which is why is the lead researcher. It can not continue without him. Meanwhile we could spare him from his fate and bring him back to his research, although the liason is concerned that he will not end his habit of partying, which could become a problem in the future.\n\nAs a compromise, a young assistant of Ascarius has proposed the we let the trial go ahead, and after his sentence is decided, blackmail him to speed up progress on his project. If he does not listen, and the project is not complete by the deadline, he will be back in jail. This may be a bit extralegal, but given the nature of our country, it should not be too hard to accomplish. In the end, they choice is yours..."

In no time, information about his lack of progress would reach Arantigos, and then...well, he knew the rumors of how short-tempered the Emperor was. But he knows he is close - and soon the secrets of Star Swirl’s magic will finally be revealed. When years ago he found copy of one of his great tractates about magic, he knew he could achieve truly great things, even if on the back of Star Swirls' own acheivements.\n\nAnd now, when he was so closed, he would not be stopped by those greedy griffons. And so they worked, day and night, trying to finish their project and prepare a working prototype. Now it is ready - first they need to make few tests of short-range teleportation. The air was buzzing with energy, as crystal pylons were loaded into the machine. When all was ready, Ascarius pulled the lever... but stones they wanted to teleport did not dissapeared.\n\n"What is going on?" the annoyed unicorn asked one of his assistants.\n\n"I have no idea. Everything seems fine, energy readings are growing..."\n\nAscarius pushed him away from the screens and tried to understand what was happening. A few moments later he started shaking from fear."Turn it off! TURN IT OFF! We are not teleporting these away, we are summoning something HERE! It will overload whole system!"\n\nBut before anyone could react, the device suddenly stopped buzzing, and then it exploded. Waves of light scorched everything it touched - machines, ponies and griffons, turning them all into dust. In a few seconds, everyone inside the facility was dead.

Our scientists are still arguing about the name, but clearly, the world Greenfeather came from is much different from ours. In his world, the Empire did not collapse, and instead was engaged in brutal fighting with the River Empire. During one of the battles, Reiner's command post was attacked by an experimental unicorn spell, that instead of killing him, somehow linked with the Silver Key device and transported him here.\n\nAlthough his stories of things like the Equestrian king, Sombra, alicorn demons ravaging Equus and other more bizarre events will provide excellent material for novels, they are not very useful for us - and apparently the technology of his dimension was similar to ours. Project Silver Key will be shut down owing to the death of entire staff, including Ascarius himself - without him we are not able to rebuild the device.

arantiga_news.8.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After General-Regent Lysimachus had taken control of Southern Griffonia, news from these lands became scarce. The information that does get out of the “Black spot of Griffonia” through refugees is truly horrifying. Lysimachus has established a brutal, theocratic dictatorship. Citizens are told that the outside world wants nothing more than to destroy them. They are forced to worship the “Eternal Emperor Arantigos” in order to reach salvation. All resisting griffons either end up in labour camps or get murdered. But recently, a piece of official news left Arantiga: its government proclaims formation of the “Holy Arantigan Empire”, and declares all other rulers of Griffonia traitors to the one true god – Arantigos. Also, the Arantigan government threatens “retaliation” against anygriff who “dares” to disturb the isolation of their realm. Despite unanimous condemnation of the Arantigan regime, it is uncertain whether anyone will be willing to directly attack the rogue state, especially considering rumors of them actively developing nuclear weapons."

While they could consider themselves “lucky” to even be allowed to live another day by the mad warlord, many have perished during their sail to the surrounding islands where the survivors now suffer from famine due to local economy being completely overwhelmed by the amount of incoming refugees.

However, due to an influx of refugees who managed to flee the country, news about a wide-scale genocide in Sicameon have recently reached the rest of the world. To crush a larg Sicameonese revolt, Arantigans started to slaughter all they suspected of supporting the rebels, and set the vast southern jungles ablaze to deprive the rebels of shelter. Hundreds of thousands have perished, and much of Sicameon has been ruined. Those rebels who remained lost the will to oppose Lysimachus.

### Leaders ###
generic_neutral_leader_desc:0 "Baroness Margareth Featherin has been ruling Arantiga for the past decade with a just and fair claw, but even she cannot deny that under her reign, there has been a decisive lack of progress as Wingbardian capitalists seized most of the Arantigan industry. However, she believes that the pen is mightier than the sword, and that Arantiga's current woes can be resolved with a few careful words, something her more notable brother and general in the army, Dorotheos, disagrees with."
literally_alexander_desc:0 "The younger brother of the former Baroness, Dorotheos Featherin has been yearning to learn about the Arantigan military as long as he could remember. He spent many hours in the national library perusing the tales of old Arantigos, how he had defeated armies more numerous than his, only to be felled by the plague after his latest conquest. Since then, Dorotheos has made it his life goal to join the Arantigan officer corps, with his brilliant mind astounding even the most senior leadership. His quick rise to success can be attributed solely to his capabilities, and once he was in position to reform the armed forces, he did so with great fervour, restoring some of their old glory. But this was not enough for Dorotheos, as he wished above all to restore the ancient Kingdom. The die was cast, and the coup was a success - he shall restore Arantiga's glory.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Truffle Shine"
generic_harmony_birb_desc:0 "One of the many Wingbardian investors who made their fortune in Arantiga, Antioco Moro has made Arantiga his home. Smitten by the local culture and history, he has invested much of his profits into rebuilding Arantiga, and unlike his fellow capitalists, his workers had a fair paycheck and numerous benefits. The dreadful coup has almost destroyed his lifework, and he was one of the first to gather his political party for the elections, campaigning on the promises of a better, peaceful Arantiga. The populace have not forgotten his contribution to the society, and he now leads Arantiga to a brighter tomorrow."
another_nazbol_guy_desc:0 "A feverishly patriotic Arantigan, Ciriaco Mediate spent the better part of his life climbing through the ranks of the Arantigan army, starting from the very bottom within the branch of ground reconnaisance.\nNot long after his transfer to the headquarters of the Arantigan armed forces, he experienced an ideological awakening after he read a particularly thought-provoking manifesto. The Rozenkamp brothers' brilliant combination of ultranationalist thought and socialist economics inspired him, and he started cultivating Rozenkampist support among the Arantigan brass.\nAlthough some suspect he covertly supported Dorotheos in his failed coup, he denies all such claims, citing ideological differences between him and the late baron.\nUltimately, Ciriaco's extreme ideology found fertile ground in every aspect of Arantiga's society, even as some questioned its viability."
alexander_but_woke_desc:0 "Dorotheos Featherin has heard Boreas' instructions and he has taken them well. Having proclaimed himself the reborn Arantigos, he is set to fulfill his destiny and reestablish the ancient Kingdom. This he swears.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Truffle Shine"
crazed_fanboy_desc:0 "Son of an Arantigos-Boreas' priest, Lysimachus spent his childhood learning about the old faith and glorious history of ancient Arantigan warriors. From a very early age, he knew what he was destined for – instead of following in his father's pawsteps, he enrolled into a military academy. Thanks to his talent and determination, he became the youngest officer to be admitted into the Legions' general staff. Soon, he get introduced to Dorotheos. His aspirations were fascinating – restoration of the old faith and traditions, reconquest of the long-lost lands... But it wasn't words that truly captivated Lysimachus – the way Dorotheos moved, spoke; the flame in his eyes... Surely, he was blessed by Arantigos himself! Ever since that fateful meeting, Lysimachus has been adamantly loyal to Dorotheos.\n\nHe will never forget that last conversation with his master. It happened on the day before he would descend into the Abyss to reclaim the Idol, to become Arantigos Reborn – on the day before his king died. Oh, how courageously he spoke... In the ensuing chaos, Lysimachus acted swiftly and decisively – he had to protect the legacy of the Second Arantigos at all costs.\n\nIt is obvious that the death of his sovereign, whom he wholeheartedly believed to be reborn Arantigos the Great has deeply shaken Lysimachus. Though his mind remains sharp, he is prone to fits of rage and paranoia, and he has become even more fanatical than he was before. Believing himself to be the only one worthy to lead Arantiga, Lysimachus is reforging it into a state of faith and unquestionable obedience to the ruler – destroying anyone who stands in his way.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo the Pone"

Despite his dislike for Wingbardians, Nicator supported the baroness. Still, he joined the plot of Dorotheos, believing, like many others, that he would bring back the long-lost Arantigan glory. However, events of the last few years made Nicator realise how wrong he was. He witnessed the alarming growth of Dorotheos' expansionist ambitions, the twisting of Arantigan culture and religious tradition...

soter_president_desc:0 "No one could predict that Soter Litori, nicknamed "Owl" by his colleagues, would ever achieve true greatness. Though a capable commander on his own, Soter was never particularly ambitious throughout his life, seemingly content with following others. As part of the Legions' high command he was considered reliable and was able to easily cooperate with other generals, no matter how great their ego was. Soter, however, always knew an opportunity when he saw one. First supporting Dorotheos' coup, later letting Nicator plan out his scheme, Soter was preparing for his own rise to power. By uniting left-wing parties and then agitating the masses through populism, he managed to win the elections, despite being considered an unlikely candidate at first. Now, as a leader he can be best described as a "pragmatist". While appearing to be a devout socialist, he cares most about his own power and uses ideology solely to further his own goals of keeping and extending his control over Arantiga. Some of his followers even created a term "Litorism" to describe the eclectic ideology of their ruler – populistic, authoritarian socialism with nominally functional democratic institutions."
JER_POLITICS_Charles_DESC:0 "Charles-Guillaume-Ferdinand de Greifenwald-Strawberry, a distinguished marchal of the Aquileian army and a devout monarchist, found himself in a peculiar position: Queen Vivienne has clearly betrayed her country by allowing Arantigan agents to infiltrate the government and the army command, and now, feeling threatened by the coup, fled to her husband in Arantiga. Now Charles is the head of the Discret Regency Committee and de-facto leader of Aquileia. Despite his inexperience in politics, he is determined to not let the actions of the former queen go unpunished and to find a worthy successor to be placed upon the Aquileian throne."

### Decisions ###
ARA_remove_influence:0 "Remove Wingbardian Influence"
ARA_arantigans_abroad:0 "Arantigans Abroad"
ARA_arantigans_abroad_desc:0 "Centuries ago, Arantigos led his mighty army to conquer all of Griffonia. He died before was able to realise his dream, and his empire collapsed soon after his death. Arantigans have no forgotten their legacy, and we were, and still are, famed for our martial traditions. There are plenty of mercenary companies composed of Arantigans, their descendants or groups of griffons who have not forgotten their heritage and who are willing to return to their ancestral homeland to reclaim its former glory..."
ARA_last_legion:0 "Hire the Karthin Legion"
ARA_last_legion_desc:0 "The so called 'Karthin Legion' claims to be the descended from the armies of the fallen Kingdom of Karthin, conquered by Wingbardians ages ago. There is little truth to this claim, but there is no doubt that the legion has existed for centuries and they are considered as one of the most battle-hardened companies in the whole of Griffonia."
ARA_true_legion:0 "Hire the Romau Legion"
ARA_true_legion_desc:0 "Romau was the northenmost city of the Arantigan Empire, founded as a border stronghold by Arantigos himself. Before it became the seat of the Eyrite Archonate, many citizens worshipped Arantigos-Boreas. Small groups of such believers still exist to this day, banding with the remnants of the Romau Legionnaires to form the 'Romau Legion' when Grover II sacked the city."
ARA_francistrian_volunteers:0 "Recruit Talousian Volunteers"
ARA_francistrian_volunteers_desc:0 "Though most Talousians have abandoned old traditions, there are still many who believe in Arantigan ways. Some of them might be willing to join our cause and fight for the true successor of Arantigos – they just need a little encouragement."
ARA_call_diaspora:0 "Recall the Diaspora"
ARA_call_diaspora_desc:0 "Many native Arantigans live abroad in cities like Karthin, Griffenheim, and Manehattan. By organizing propaganda campaigns, perhaps we can encourage some of them to return and help us regain our former greatness..."

ARA_blyat_cat:0 "Into the Rats' Nest"
ARA_blyat_cat_desc:0 "Though we did not intend to invade Blackhollow just now due to its insignificance, its sudden incursion into Griffonstone messed up our plans for the territory. This leaves us with no choice but to get rid of the bandits."
ARA_blyat:0 "Punish the Bandits"
ARA_blyat_desc:0 ""

ARA_renaming_cities:0 "Renaming Cities"
ARA_renaming_cities_desc:0 "Our great empire is dotted with massive cities. Some cities have made us look the fool, and others are simply hard for our adminstrators to write down or speak out loud. A name change is in order."
ARA_rename_karthin:0 "Down with Karthin!"
ARA_rename_karthin_desc:0 "Now, with the former capital of Wingbardy in our claws, maybe it is time to show our superiority and rename the city to make it a reminder for those who would ever dare to oppose our divine king..."

ARA_definetely_not_fake_IRI:0 "The Imperial Research Initiative"
ARA_definetely_not_fake_IRI_desc:0 "The IRI, or the Imperial Research Initiative, is an umbrella programme that allows us to invest funds into promising research projects that many consider unethical or dangerous without inviting...unwanted attention. While many of the so-called 'scientists' are nothing but frauds, some former Yalish students have promising ideas and are asking for financial support.\n\n§YNote: These projects will be incredibly costly...§!\n\n§RThere is always a risk of something going horribly wrong...§!"
ARA_hammer_of_god:0 "Project Gotterhammer"
ARA_hammer_of_god_desc:0 "Magical crystals are known as a source of incredible power. With their use, magicians are able to change reality and they are a crucial component of most magitek equipment. Bright Glow, a nuclear scientist from Aquileia has presented plans of an experimental 'crystal bomb' that may provide us with the ultimate weapon of mass destruction."
ARA_miracle_cure:0 "Project Panaceum"
ARA_miracle_cure_desc:0 "A group of researchers from Greenback University has requested our support for their research into a so-called 'universal cure'. They intend to use 'Magiforgs', modified microorganisms, to heal even the most deadly diseases and, as for now, tests results are highly promising."
ARA_super_soldiers:0 "Project Legionary"
ARA_super_soldiers_desc:0 "Although Gamia University was almost completely devastated during conflicts in Herzland, one of its researchers, Heinrich Allenstein, is offering us his services in improving the physical capabilities of our soldiers - if we provide him with enough...test subjects. However we should be careful; he was expelled for experiments even his colleagues considered...unethical."
ARA_teleportation_device:0 "Project Silver Key"
ARA_teleportation_device_desc:0 "Despite being talented in many ways, griffons lack the magical abilities of unicorns, who are able to cast a wide variety of spells. Luckily, we might be able to solve this problem in part - a powerful Wittenlander mage, Ascarius, who, after losing favours at court, arrived in griffon lands after working for many years on various MagiTek projects - and now has offered us his services, hoping we could finance a teleportation device he is designing."
ARA_quinctus:0 "Project Revival"
ARA_quinctus_desc:0 "There are many rumours about the magical horrors unleashed by the half-mad, half-genius mages that reigned in Barrad. Of course, many griffon scholars are eager to dig into what remains of their lodgings in hope of uncovering arcane technology and magical secrets. A team of researchers has assembled to launch an expedition into the cursed castle in Barrad that the Pentarchy used to occupy."

ARA_return_land_cat:0 "Griffons of the East"
ARA_return_land_cat_desc:0 "The eastern part of Griffonia is known as the "Riverlands". These lands are inhabited by many creatures, but among them most numerous and powerful are ponies. Now Riverponies, taking advantage of the chaos after the fall of the Griffonian Empire have invaded its former eastern lands. For Arantigos to claim the mantle of the emperor of all griffons, we need to reclaim these lands. We will issue an ultimatum for the return of these lands!"
ARA_return_land:0 "Issue an ultimatum!"

ARA_northern_threat:0 "The Northern Threat"
ARA_northern_threat_desc:0 "It came to our attention that the Dread Peninsula – the northeastern tip of the Griffonian continent – fell under control of a malicious force – a council of powerful necromancers led by the most insidious of them – Rosa Maledicta. Having such a neighbor bothers noblegriffs within the Imperial Court. Many call for preemptive actions to be taken against the necromancers."
ARA_kill_DED:0 "Attack the Dread League"
ARA_order2electricboogaloo:0 "Restore order on the Dread Peninsula"
GOY_ARA_new_new_order:0 "Reform the Arcturian Order"
GOY_ARA_new_new_order_desc:0 "Clearly, the blame for 'mismanagement' of the necromancer threat falls squarely on the shoulders of the Arcturian Order's headmaster and his entourage. So, a change of leadership is in order."
GOY_ARA_give_hlr_to_ntr:0 "Hand over the Dread Peninsula to Hyperborea"
GOY_ARA_give_hlr_to_ntr_desc:0 "The necromancers have been defeated once and for all, so there is no more need for any 'knightly orders' to contain this nonexistent threat. The Dread Peninsula will be better of in the hands of our Hyperborean partners."

ARA_puppet_show_cat:0 "Soter's Amazing Puppet Show"
ARA_puppet_show_cat_desc:0 "Welcome, welcome to our President-General's great political show! Pangriffonianism is an ideal as moronic as an average voter, and attempting to control a truly pangriffonian nation would be a hopeless endeavour. Luckily, we've come up with a better idea – instead of governing newly acquired lands directly, we will set up "sister republics" and let like-minded collaborators deal with their problems. Our rule over the "sister republics" will be hardly noticeable so the locals won't be urged to unite against us. Let’s redraw the maps!"

ARA_peace_nm_cat:0 "Peace Offer"
ARA_peace_nm_cat_desc:0 "We have vanquished puny armies of Equestria and New Mareland. Now major cities of the colony are under our control and we can dictate the terms of peace. As our triumphing legions parade through the streets of Sunset, Equestria will be taught a lesson – to never oppose the true masters of this world."
ARA_peace_nm:0 "Send our Demands"

ARA_greneclyf_cat:0 "An Unexpected Acquisition"
ARA_greneclyf_cat_desc:0 "Island of Green... Grenkl... Grenen... THE BUG ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE is such a remote part of Griffonia that many even forget it exists. Yet, now that we control it, we have to figure out a way to govern it. Its value for our empire is negligible, so we shall simply establish a protectorate there, appointing one of the local queens as a governor, and prompty forget that this place exists."
ARA_greneclyf:0 "Form a Protectorate"

ARA_arantigan_restorations:0 "Karthinia Reclamation"
ARA_sparleos_decision:0 "Claim the Mantle"

Presently, we stand in control of the heartland of this ancient realm and so, now we're truly able name our state the Second Kingdom of Sparleos and integrate our southern griffon brothers into it."
ARA_karthinia_decision:0 "Unify Karthinia"
ARA_karthinia_decision_desc:0 "Now, when we control all the south, we need to become something more than just “Arantiga”. While we already have established a tolerant, multicultural nation, time has come fuse all the southern cultures into one – to reach back into the past and restore traditions of the old Karthinian Republic."

ARA_canteribbienes_cat:0 "The Canteribbean Campaign"
ARA_canteribbienes_cat_desc:0 "Location of the Canteribbean Islands makes them a valuable territory for anyone wishing to control major shipping routes between Equus and Zebrica – or anyone willing to launch an invasion of Griffonia, using them as rally points. With these islands secured, we will create a forward defence perimetre for Griffonia, while also securing valuable naval bases for our navy."
ARA_reclaim_merediennes:0 "Reclaim Les Meridiennes"
ARA_reclaim_merediennes_desc:0 "Les Meridiennes are a former Aquileian colony, following the Second Revolution, stranded from the mainland. With its large griffon population, they are our primary target in the Canteribbeans."
ARA_lay_dragons:0 "Dragonslaying"
ARA_lay_dragons_desc:0 "Dragon Islands were for centuries a place of terror, where no griffon in sound mind dared venture. With recent advancements in technology however, dragons do not pose as much of a threat as they once did, while islands' location near shores of Equus makes them a perfect location for the future base of the Celestial Sea Fleet."
#ARA_lay_dragons_desc:1 "The Dragon Islands are a land of some of the hottest b*tches of the world. The Imperial Navy advises deploying our marines there in an attempt to capture Queen Ember and bring her as a concubine to Emperor Arantigos "Thundercock" the Second"
ARA_operation_solstice:0 "Operation Solstice"
ARA_operation_solstice_desc:0 "Summer Islands, a small and insignificant Equestrian colony in the Canteribbeans have little population and economic value. However, they are crucial for the defence of Les Meridiennes. A team of highly trained commandos shall land on Summer Islands and take them over. No reasonable pony would be willing to die for this piece of land, so we do not expect any resistance."
ARA_puerto_caballo:0 "Control the Bay of Boars"
ARA_puerto_caballo_desc:0 "Puerto Caballo is the largest and most populous island of the Canteribbeans. A former Equestrian colony, now Puerto Caballo is stranded from their mainland overlord and will be an easy target."
ARA_demand_eqs_islands:0 "Demand Equestrian Colonies"

ARA_yukka_treaty:0 "Victory at Sea"
ARA_yukka_treaty_desc:0 "With Equestrians facing defeat after defeat, we can press our demands and get what we started this war for."

ARA_dev_islands_cat:0 "Canteribbean Development Programme"
ARA_dev_islands_cat_desc:0 "While many disregard Canteribbeans as a bunch of unimportant, poor islands, the Emperor has decided to divert substantial resources in order to integrate these territories and extract their untapped natural resources, while the Imperial Admiralty requested further funds to develop island bases, needed for our Zebrican Fleet."
ARA_core_meridiennes:0 "Integrate Les Meridiennes"
ARA_core_meridiennes_desc:0 "Les Meridiennes, being former Aquileian colonies, are inhabited by many griffons. Locals seem to be relatively friendly, and we should face no issues with integrating them into our glorious empire."
ARA_canterib_capital:0 "New Capital of the Canteribbeans"
ARA_canterib_capital_desc:0 "Port-Giselda, or as it will be known now, Port-Featherin, will become the centre of our power within the Canteribbeans, and as such, will be built up into a bustling metropolis, showing the glory of our empire."
ARA_island_rubber:0 "Expand Island Rubber Plantations"
ARA_island_rubber_desc:0 "The climate of the Canteribbeans is perfect for growing rubber-producing trees, called “hevea” by locals. With rubber being in constant deficit, setting up hevea plantations on the archipelago is a sound idea."

ARA_summer_harbour:0 "Establish the Summer Harbour"
ARA_summer_harbour_desc:0 "For protection of Les Meridiennes, a proper naval base must be established on Summer Islands – so claims the apparently hastily-drafted request from the Zebrican Fleet Command."
ARA_purrsia_colonisation:0 "Colonisation of Purrsia"
ARA_purrsia_colonisation_desc:0 "The island of Purrsia is a key to Western Zebrica. Years of Wingbardian presence made local felines receptive towards our culture, and compelled a good number of griffons to move to the island. We shall further encourage the process, and make Purrsia into a model Arantigan colony in Zebrica."

#tungsten_desc:0 "Literally just a piece of tungsten. It was promoted in 1005 by Dorotheos as a way to poke fun at Nicator and as such, it has its own desk, uniform, salary, and right to be present in the general staff meetings."
soter_desc:0 "Soter Litori, the owl of Arantiga, was born in 980 in the forests south of Ponteles. One of the brightest mind of the Arantigan general staff, his upbringing in the boondocks gave him the skills to traverse the thick forests of Arantiga with ease, and teach others how to do it. This, along with his charisma and great loyalty to the state of Arantiga made him (at the time of his promotion at 26 years old) the youngest General in the Arantigan Army."
