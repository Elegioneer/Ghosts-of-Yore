BOI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC1:0 "Griffonstone – the first griffon settlement – stands a shadow of its former self. With the loss of the Idol of Boreas and the death of the last Guto king, total collapse has befallen the Home of Griffons. Commoners live in poverty, the Republican Movement is slowly gaining traction among the hopeless masses, factions of the Regency Council are too busy fighting for power to do anything to alleviate the country's many issues, Grandpa Gruff, the Chancellor, seems to have fallen into complete apathy regarding the matters of the state. Who will be the one to bring hope to this sad place?"

## Leaders ##
GOY_BOI_grandpagruff:0 "Grandpa Gruff"
BOI_grandpa_desc:0 "“Grandpa” Gruff was born in 930 ALB near Wohnitz to an impoverished noble house. In his early age he enrolled in the Military Academy of Griffonstone to later join the Royal Griffon Defense Force. Not long after doing so, he, as a promising young officer, was transferred to the Royal Guard. He rose through its ranks, becoming a captain of the Guard in the year 965 ALB. Gruff served faithfully to king Guto VI, becoming a friend and a confidant of the monarch. \nWhen Cyclops Arimaspi attacked Griffonstone in 971, Gruff led the Royal Guard to protect the Idol of Boreas. However, during the fight, he was heavily wounded and incapacitated. Being on the brink of death, he was unable to follow his king who died trying to stop the beast. The attack and its coutcome left Gruff a changed griffon.\nWith the loss of the Idol, Griffonstone entered a period of decline. The Royal Guard was disbanded, but Gruff continued dutifully serving his country, joining the Regency Council and becoming its chancellor in 983 – his impartiality making him a perfect compromise candidate. The Council soon proved to be ineffectual due to factionalism grinding all rational discussion around new reforms to a halt. Despite his best efforts, chancellor Gruff was unable to break this political deadlock, with his last hope for Griffonstone’s salvation dying with its last sovereign, Guto VII, in 992 during an expedition. Since then, chancellor has grown seemingly indifferent to all problems of Griffonstone due to grief, guilt, and old age.\nHowever, even though he may seem a bitter, hopeless, senile bird, Gruff still loves his nation and stands as its last guardian, defending its riches from greedy nobles in the Regency Council."
GOY_BOI_gallus:0 "Gallus"
BOI_gallus_desc:0 "The past of Gallus was intentionally shrouded in mystery by his guardian. An orphan, said to be a son of a female cobbler from Wohnitz and an unknown father, he was taken care of by Gruff who claimed to be an old friend of his grandfather. At first, Gruff did not pay much attention to the child’s upbringing, so he mostly spent time roaming the streets of Griffonstone, looking for trouble. To the surprise of many, later Gruff sent Gallus to the Equestrian School of Friendship, where he spent a few years receiving the best education this world could provide. Returning to Griffonstone, Gallus was revealed the truth about his family – Gallus was, in fact, an illegitimate child of prince Guto VII – making him the last heir to the throne of Griffonstone. To dispel doubt from the minds of those who declared this story to be fraudulent, Gallus descended to the bottom of the Abyss in which the Idol of Boreas was lost during the attack of cyclops Arimaspi, and reclaimed the ancient artifact. This was widely considered to be the ultimate proof of legitimacy, and Gallus was crowned King of Griffonstone.\nThough young and inexperienced, he has the popular support and a few loyal griffons in the government. He is determined to rebuild his homeland and spread friendship and harmony among its griffons and beyond."
GOY_BOI_gilda:0 "Gilda"
BOI_gilda_desc:0 "For the larger part of her life, Gilda could be considered a typical modern Griffonstonian – rude, unpleasant even to other locals, and caring only for gathering enough bits to leave Griffonstone. A baker, she sold infamous griffonscones, considered awful even by griffonian cuisine standards, (nevertheless known as the national dish of Griffonstone). However, her life was changed by a visit of two ponies from Equestria – seemingly indifferent to problems of her homeland, Gilda suddenly changed her attitude and became a key figure of the fledgling republican movement, unifying its various groups into a proper political party. Even though she is still known for her rudeness and short temper, she actually cares for Griffonstone and its citizens and will do all she can to forge a better future for them."
GOY_BOI_gestal:0 "Lord Gestal"
BOI_gestal_leader_desc:0 "Through generations, Gestals faithfully served their Kaisers – and the young heir was expected to follow in the footsteps of his ancestors. When the Revolution overthrew the Emperor in 978, Gestal, then a young cadet, left Griffenheim to join loyalist forces in the North. During the war he bravely fought for the Imperial Cause, yet his career in Reichsarmee was cut short by the death of his father. Gestal had to return to Griffonstone and, while he was unable to stop the kingdom from seceding, he quickly became the leader of the pro-imperial faction in the Regency Council. Ever since his return, Gestal has been tirelessly working to reunite Griffonstone with the Empire.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo the Pone"
GOY_BOI_goldstone:0 "Lord Goldstone"
BOI_goldstone_desc:0 "Head of a venerable noble dynasty, Goldstone earned his sinister reputation quite early – when his older brother and heir to the title suffered from a deadly “accident”, and soon after was followed by his father. Goldstone was quick to grab power and start rapid expansion of his family’s wealth and power. Dealing with all kinds of “legitimate” businesses, ranging from mines of unlawful safety standards to weapon smuggling cartels, lord Goldstone managed to flourish in slowly crumbling Griffonstone. Even though many are aware of his actions, he has enough power and connections to never get caught. Through the years, thanks to his diplomatic skills, immeasurable wealth, and use of covert criminal operations he established himself as one of key figures in Griffonstonian politics.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo the Pone"
GOY_BOI_gertrude:0 "Gertrude"
GOY_BOI_eros:0 "Archon Eros VII"
GOY_BOI_duchess:0 "Empress Gabriela Eagleclaw"
GOY_BOI_duchess_desc:0 "Following tragic death of the last scion of imperial dynasty, Gabriela Eagleclaw, cousin of the emperor Grover V became the claimant to the title of the empress of all Griffonia. A rallying figure for the griffonian royalists, her realm was nevertheless plunged into chaos alongside rest of Herzland, following the Lord Protector coup. !\n\nHowever thanks to the intervention of the griffonstonian loyalists, duchess of Strawberry was put on imperial throne – and now to honor the legacy of the Grovers, she strives to rebuilt what was lost – and restore Empire to its former glory. !\n\n She is a staunch supporter of the nobility and she will try to uphold the balance between the nobles, religion and the people. She does truly care for her people though, and wants to see them prosper above all else."

#Deadlock
BOI_fallen_kingdom:0 "Fallen Kingdom"
BOI_fallen_kingdom_desc:0 "Thirty years of continuous political deadlock and economic decay turned Griffonstone into a husk of a nation. The Regency Council is seemingly unable to solve any of the nation's problems and only spends time on pointless squabbling and fights between factions."
BOI_hire_new_troops:0 "Hire New Troops"
BOI_hire_new_troops_desc:0 "The Royal Griffon Defence Force is dangerously undergunned, undergriffoned, and undertrained. Though we can't provide them with proper funding, we were able to scrape some money to hire at least a few desperately needed reinforcements."
BOI_mines_of_goldstone:0 "Mines Of Goldstone"
BOI_mines_of_goldstone_desc:0 "In ages passed, Griffonstone was famed for its gold and silver mines. However, as centuries passed, these mines ran dry – today only the ones belonging to Lord Goldstone provide a steady flow of precious metals..."
BOI_grovel_for_help:0 "Grovel For Help"
BOI_grovel_for_help_desc:0 "Though we have seceded from the Empire a while ago, there is still a strong faction within the Regency Council arguing for realignment with Griffenheim. Leader of those griffons, Lord Gestal, has some powerful friends in the imperial court and could ask them for help..."
BOI_prepare_for_war:0 "Prepare For the Next War"
BOI_prepare_for_war_desc:0 "We are surrounded by enemies, and it is only a question of time before they attack. Currently, the Royal Griffon Defence Force is outdated and unprepared to defend our nation. We should organise maneuvers to assess its state and prepare to reform it."
BOI_whip_council:0 "Whip the Council into Operation"
BOI_whip_council_desc:0 "Through screaming, pulling favours, and making false promises Grandpa Gruff will try once again to make the Regency Council actually do something to rebuild our nation. This will not be an easy task..."
BOI_discuss_reforms:0 "Discuss Reforms"
BOI_discuss_reforms_desc:0 "Although the Regency Council is a pointlessly squabbling bunch of powerful griffons, perhaps there is a chance of forcing or convincing them to cooperate for the good of the nation (or if they do not care about that, just to prevent revolution). Achieving such a compromise will not be simple..."
#Air
BOI_create_airforce:0 "Create Airforce"
BOI_create_airforce_desc:0 "As our nation's military is hopelessly outdated, we need to catch up with other powers of Griffonia. Until now we possessed no actual air force – it's the best time to change this."
BOI_import_fighters:0 "Import Fighters"
BOI_import_fighters_desc:0 "Creating our own fighter designs from scratch may be difficult. Instead we can buy foreign planes and reverse-engineer them."
BOI_air_doctrine_studies:0 "Air Doctrine Studies"
BOI_air_doctrine_studies_desc:0 "Air combat is something more than just putting a few birds into planes and ordering them to attack the enemy. If we want to do it efficiently, we need to utilise proper air combat tactics."
BOI_bomber_designs:0 "Bomber Designs"
BOI_bomber_designs_desc:0 "Fighters are useless for attacking ground forces and enemy fortifications, the most we can do is drop rocks from them. We need proper bombers! We need them NOW!"

BOI_new_strategic_bombers:0 "New Strategic Bombers"
BOI_new_strategic_bombers_desc:0 "Designing bombers dedicated to long range missions and attacking enemy industry and infrastructure may be very useful – it is easier to fight an enemy who can't effectively move and supply their troops."
BOI_streamline_production:0 "Streamline Productions"
BOI_streamline_production_desc:0 "We do not need perfect airplanes – we will be perfectly fine with just decent ones. What we need is huge numbers of them – therefore it is crucial to improve our production methods."
BOI_improve_bomber_tactics:0 "Improve Bombing Tactics"
BOI_improve_bomber_tactics_desc:0 "Bombers are crucial both for direct support of our army and for disruption of enemy industry. We need to focus on improving their tactics to fully utilise their destructive capabilities."

BOI_improve_fighter_designs_desc:0 "There is still room for improvement of our fighter planes and any advantage we can get in this department will be tremendously useful."
BOI_faster_than_wind:0 "Faster Than Wind"
BOI_faster_than_wind_desc:0 "Rockets – a truly wonderful technology. With them we will be able to hit enemies hundreds or even thousands of miles away – we must get some of that new wunderwaffe!"
BOI_wetterkommando:0 "Wetterkommando"
BOI_wetterkommando_desc:0 "By constructing a number of magitech facilities on mountaintops we should be able to manipulate weather to some extent, creating more favourable conditions for our pilots. Of course maintaining such facilities will require a large amount of resources..."
BOI_destroyer_of_worlds:0 "Destroyer of Worlds"
BOI_destroyer_of_worlds_desc:0 "The theory of Maginucelar Weapons was formulated a few years ago. Until now we lacked knowledge to develop such armaments. As our enemies are surely trying to do so it would be wise for us to join the race."
#Navy
BOI_birth_navy:0 "Birth Of Our Navy"
BOI_birth_navy_desc:0 "As Griffonstone has never had access to the sea, our navy is nonexistent and so are our naval traditions. Now however, as we finally control coastal regions it is time to think about establishing a proper navy."
BOI_construct_cruisers:0 "Construct Cruisers"
BOI_construct_cruisers_desc:0 "Cruisers are a backbone of every navy and we should build some of such ships for ourselves."

BOI_destroyer_design:0 "Destroyer Designs"

BOI_expand_trade_fleet:0 "Expand our Trade Fleet"

BOI_good_old_battleships:0 "Good Old Battleship"
BOI_good_old_battleships_desc:0 "Battleships were a backbone of navies for decades and will most likely remain in such position in the following decades. If we want to rival other naval powers we should create our own battleship fleet."
BOI_rely_on_carriers:0 "Rely on Carriers"
BOI_rely_on_carriers_desc:0 "It is obvious that carriers are the future of naval warfare – they may be expensive but by using them we will control both sea and air."
BOI_new_submarines:0 "New Submarines"
BOI_new_submarines_desc:0 "Submarines may prove useful for both raiding our enemies' convoys and attacking their warships. As our enemies will most likely outnumber us, perhaps the covert approach will be best for us."
BOI_griffonstonian_admiralty:0 "Griffonstonian Admiralty"
BOI_griffonstonian_admiralty_desc:0 "As our navy grows so do its needs. To properly command a large number of ships, plan operations, and further improve our tactics, we need a dedicated command, which shall handle such tasks."
#Army
BOI_royal_defence_force:0 "Royal Griffon Defence Force"
BOI_royal_defence_force_desc:0 "RGDF is an ancient formation whose origins could be traced to the days before equestrian princesses. Now however it is just a sad reminder of its former glory – undergriffoned, underequipped, and horribly outdated. If we want to defend ourselves it needs to change."
BOI_reichsarmee_veterans:0 "Reichsarmee Veterans"
BOI_reichsarmee_veterans_desc:0 "Reichsarmee was once the greatest army of Griffonia. After the fall of the Empire a substantial number of old imperial personnel from the south ended up in Griffonstone. By recruiting them we could improve the state of our officer corps."
BOI_recruitment_drive:0 "Recruitment Drive"
BOI_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "Even if we had guns, we would need griffons to use them. We should organise propaganda campaigns to encourage more griffons to join RGDF."
BOI_modern_firearms:0 "Purchase Modern Firearms"
BOI_modern_firearms_desc:0 "Weapons we are currently using were quite good... a few generations ago! Now they should be in a museum. As Griffonstone is severely lacking in manufacturing capabilities, the best option may be to buy foreign equipment and try to copy it."
BOI_griffons_army:0 "Griffons’ Army"
BOI_griffons_army_desc:0 "An age of industrial warfare has come - an age of armies that dwarf in size smaller nations. We cannot rely any longer on levies loyal only to nobles of Griffonstone - it is time to establish a proper national army."
BOI_why_fight:0 "Why we Fight"
BOI_why_fight_desc:0 "Soldiers are not just cattle forced to charge into enemy lines. We need to make sure that every soldier knows for what he is exactly fighting and feels rightful pride from being a defender of Griffonstone."
BOI_common_soldier_care:0 "Care For the Common Soldier"
BOI_common_soldier_care_desc:0 "Though we cannot prevent certain losses it is crucial that we provide all possible help for the wounded – it's a reasonable and griffonitarian thing to do."
BOI_noble_levies:0 "Noble Levies"
BOI_noble_levies_desc:0 "For centuries the nobility was protecting Griffonstone, and why should we change it? Surely, those who were raised to rule will be the ones best suited for leading the new army of Griffonstone."
BOI_right_to_rule:0 "Right to Rule"
BOI_right_to_rule_desc:0 "Generation after generation lords and nobles of Griffonstone were defending our great city. They learned how to command respect from an early age and know that if they fail, not only they will be ashamed, but all of their descendants too."
BOI_emulate_reichsarmee:0 "Emulate Reichsarmee"
BOI_emulate_reichsarmee_desc:0 "Many of our officers served in Reichsarmee in the past. Thanks to their experience we can drill our forces into army that will be able to rival the old Imperial Army"

BOI_support_the_army:0 "Support Battalions"
BOI_support_the_army_desc:0 "Only fools think that the army consists solely of combatants – without proper support they would be easy pickings for their enemies. It is time to provide such support for the Griffonstonian Army."
BOI_eyes_ears:0 "Eyes and Ears"
BOI_eyes_ears_desc:0 "A new technology called “RADAR” is very intriguing – with it we will be able to provide our forces with much better intel about enemy movements – it would be foolish not to use it."
BOI_military_academy:0 "Griffonstonian Military Academy"
BOI_military_academy_desc:0 "We can't rely only on veterans and hope that new officers will learn the art of warfare on the battlefield. Instead we should create a proper military academy to raise new generations of commanders."
BOI_weltbaum:0 "Weltbaum Project"
BOI_weltbaum_desc:0 "The Griffonstonian Tree is as old as the Griffonkind – possibly even older. Considered sacred, it is a popular pilgrimage destination. However the tree itself is a powerful magical object of potential that has not been fully understood until now. With recent advancements in magitech we came to be able to utilise its unique properties. Of course more pious griffons will be displeased with such actions."
BOI_flesh:0 "Flesh"
BOI_flesh_desc:0 "Even the best equipment is nothing without a griffon to wield it. It's not machines, but soldiers who win battles – and we should ensure that our soldiers are provided with the best possible training and equipment."
BOI_birdwave:0 "Birdwave Tactics"
BOI_birdwave_desc:0 "There is no such thing as "too many soldiers"."
BOI_modernise_eq:0 "Modernise Equipment"
BOI_modernise_eq_desc:0 "We have already started to improve our infantry weapons, but our efforts so far have been insufficient. We need to provide our soldiers with cutting-edge weaponry as quickly as possible – before our enemies manage to do the same."
BOI_knights_of_griffonstone:0 "Knights of Griffonstone"
BOI_knights_of_griffonstone_desc:0 "Once the Royal Guards were like true heroes from the legends of old. Perhaps the time has come to recreate this proud formation, so it could once again defend the Home of Griffons."

BOI_steel:0 "Steel"
BOI_steel_desc:0 "Throwing griffons into battle like meat into a grinder is foolish – there are too few Griffonstonians at our disposal. Instead we should concentrate on making the artillery and panzers do all the hard work."
BOI_achtung:0 "Achtung Panzers"
BOI_achtung_desc:0 "These new panzers, or as equestrians call them “tanks”, are interesting inventions that can completely change the nature of warfare. We should get some of them!"
BOI_barrage:0 "Devastating Barrage"
BOI_barrage_desc:0 "There is no problem that cannot be solved with thousands of modern cannons – no enemy will be able to withstand such fury and destruction."
BOI_new_artillery:0 "New Artillery Pieces"
BOI_new_artillery_desc:0 "If we want to fully utilise our new strategy we need to produce more artillery pieces, and, of course, better artillery pieces. Let’s provide our scientists with some funds to invent such equipment."
BOI_steel_beasts:0 "Beasts of Steel"
BOI_steel_beasts_desc:0 "Their engines are roaring! Their tracks are rolling! They will defeat our enemies! Once griffons feared monsters of powerful magic – now they will fear monsters of impenetrable steel."

BOI_sturdy_cannons_desc:0 "Artillery breeches exploding in the middle of a battle may lead to a defeat. To prevent such problems we should introduce strict quality inspection in our factories."

BOI_from_ashes_desc:0 "Griffostone is considered alongside Katerin to be one of the most miserable places in all of Griffonia. Our economy is ruined, and if we want to restore the glory of old Griffonstone, we must rebuild it. It will be a long and arduous task."
BOI_restore_roads:0 "Restore Roads"

BOI_core_south:0 "Shackle the South"
BOI_core_south_desc:0 "The "Free South" will be a thing of the past. No more shall Wingbardy and their former allies be subject states. Instead, they will be reorganized into an Imperial province.

BOI_divination_category_desc:0 "Origins of the tree, on which a large part of Griffonstone is constructed, are unknown. Priests claim that it was created by gods themselves as a gift to griffons – as their first home. Ancient myths claim that the tree is as old as the world itself and germinated in an age even before the creation of griffonkind. Some small sects claim that the Great Tree is the pillar of this world, and that its root stretch through the entire globe. Nevertheless, it is a place of powerful magic and a major place of worship. Beneath it, large cavern systems can be found, many griffons claim that true enlightenment can be achieved on pilgrimages to them. We decided to check these rumors, and, in fact, research proved that cerain interactions with the tree allow for limited precognition. Thanks to this discovery, we managed to create a facility where, using cutting-edge technology and natural tree magic, we became able to predict future – however, as future constantly changes, we can at best accurately predict the events of the next few hours, and visions can be unclear. For unknown reasons, the most clear predictions are those of calamities and bloodshed – which can be immensely useful for our military operations. Griffons who harness the powers of the tree are however prone to madness, as they tend to start failing to distinguish the present from possible futures. Prolonged usage of the tree will cause a loss of many operators."

griffonstone.001.t:0 "Homecoming"
griffonstone.001.d:0 "Although he often vehemently claimed that he despised Griffonstone, Gallus felt more than a bit of nostalgia recalling memories of his homeland during those two years he had spent in Ponyville. Yes, Equestria was a shining beacon of modernity, a place of safety and progress, and, what was most important for him, a place where he had found his true friends. But as time passed, bad memories started paling, and he started longing for home – whatever was his home. Now however, after a long journey he finally saw the "Home of Griffons" again, memories of why he despised this place came back – crumbling slums, suspicious griffons probably eager to rob him, the stench on the streets that never get cleaned, and an overbearing feeling of hopelessness plagued this place... Good ol’ Griffonstone apparently hasn't changed at all after so many years. As he traversed through the city, his mood was becoming more and more gloomy – why did Grandpa Gruff order him to return? He seemed very pleased to send Gallus as far away as possible, hopefully forever, to finally get rid of the "disobedient troublemaker and bane of my existence" as he called him during bouts of anger. Although most foreign students left the School of Friendship much earlier due to a clear threat of war with the Changelings coming, Grandpa seemed to not care about Gallus in the wake of the cataclysm that would likely claim his life. If news came that Gallus had perished on the frontlines, he would probably comment something like "Ha! I always knew, he would be foolish enough to end up as cannon fodder!" But now Gallus was here, and in the letter he had gotten he was ordered to talk to Gruff as soon as he would come back from Equestria. From his own experience Gallus knew that Grandpa would most likely be waiting for him in his study in the former royal palace, dealing with some meaningless paperwork and complaining about subordinates not executing his brilliant orders properly – and so, taking no pleasure in it, the young griffon headed there.\n\nBeing lost in his thoughts almost cost him the integrity of his beak, as the doors he was going to pass got slammed open, narrowly dodging his face. A brown-and-white-coloured griffoness came our, mumbling swear words, from which, "senile fogy" was the least vulgar. Another thing that hasn't changed in Griffonstone was Gilda's fights with Grandpa, but Gallus did not remember her leading them face-to-face before. She loudly said "Watch out, moron!" and left. Gallus sighed quietly – it was clear that Grandpa would meet him in poor mood, considering that merely seeing him would make it even worse, postponing the visit seemed very inviting... Gallus considered his options – if Gruff found out, he had come to the palace and left, the old griffon would be an even worse pain in the ass for many, many days to come."
griffonstone.001.a:0 ""Why am I here?""
griffonstone.016.t:0 "The Appointment"
griffonstone.016.d:0 "Gruff's response to someone knocking on his door was usual,\n“Who for Boreas' sake is bothering me again? Don’t you have anything else to do other than disturbing me?! If it's not important, go away!”\nGallus decided not to answer and opened the door. As he had predicted, Grandpa was busy with paperwork – most likely looking for discrepancies in recent reports he could scold his poor clerks for. \n“Ah, here you are.” Gruff said, surprisingly calmly. “I trust, your journey was safe, powderkeg known as Griffonia has been rather quiet recently... Why are you standing in the doorway, boy? Don’t you know doing so brings bad luck? Come in!” Gallus reluctantly made a few steps forward. “Good, now straighten up, crouching like this, you look like some thievish Skyfallian. Hold yourself like a proud son of Griffonstone ought to!” Listening to this, Gallus quietly sighed... Here we go again. \n“Grandpa Gruff, could you please tell me what you actually want? I’m tired, and although I absolutely love attending your little scolding sessions, there is about a million better things I can do, like... watching how paint dries for example.”\n“Well, one thing they clearly did not teach you in Equestria is good manners! But yes, I'll tell you why you're here. In each young griffon's life comes a day... And do not chuckle, it’s not the day you're thinking about, young boy! ...a day, when they finally have to stop caring only for themselves, but also for their own families. And the country is in a way a family of every griffon that lives in it. I have appointed you as an assistant of the staff of the Defence Force, or of whatever remains of it. You will help with paperwork, serve tea, or do whatever else they will need help with. Don't be ungrateful, consider this as an opportunity to learn new skills. If you prove yourself to be useful, you will become an officer, or will be transferred to the state's administration. Honest jobs. Any questions?”\n“No, but I guess I learned the term “to be volunteered” today. Great work! You gave me the needed education before sending me off to find staff!”"

Its owner seemed to be the only one who thrived amidst the general misery of the nation. Goldstone was in no rush to unveil his plan, he let the invited nobles enjoy his hospitality for a few hours. Nobles drank fine liquor, smoked Malawian cigars, discussed some meaningless topics, finally, Goldstone came to the middle of the room and loudly cleared his throat. All guests turned to him to listen.\n“Gentlegriffs, although it is indeed a pleasure to spend time with you, the Griffonstone’s brightest minds, birds of the noblest breed, the time has come for me to reveal why I gathered all of you here. Many of you are my old friends, and, I hope, the rest of you will become my trusted allies as well...”\n“Thank you, lord Goldstone, for these kind words and this delightful evening. But could you please cut to the chase?” Lord Brightwing used the first opportunity to interrupt the flood of words. Goldstone almost winced. He always disliked Brightwing, the fat profligate megalomaniac. But these were the exact traits Goldstone could feed and exploit to make ties even stronger than those based on loyalty. \n“I guess it will be for the best... We’ve come to a dead end, gentlegriffs. For years we could extract amazing profits out of Griffonstone. But now, our current position is in peril. Commoners are growing restless and if the current deadlock lasts, a revolution is imminent. Gruff, the senile idiot, won’t be able to hold the peasants back. In such case all this,” he waved his claw around, “all of our wealth and power will be lost. It’s time to act. Gestal will mumble about reclaiming old imperial glory, but do we want to bend the knee before scions of a fallen dynasty? I for sure don’t.” Nobles muttered words of confirmation. “The world is changing. In times of transition, fortune favours the bold. If we all act together, we will make sure that we will decide the future of Griffonstone and we shall reap its profits.”\nNobles started clasping – all except for Brightwing. He may have been corrupt and greedy, but he wasn’t an idiot. When enthusiasm subsided, he started talking.\n“Yes... Dividing Griffonstone between us sure does sound interesting, but we would still be a minority in the council. A more forceful approach would be needed. That means we would need to fight the Defence Force and private armies of those lords who will stand against us... The numbers are not on our side.”\n“They aren’t for now. But do not worry, I have a plan to make numbers meaningless. But for it to work, I will need your support during the next council meeting.”"

griffonstone.003.d:0 "The city of Wohnsitz also known as Eincartref is home to a substantial number of Rumareans. Though through centuries, thanks to assimilation policies and immigration of Herzlandish and Wingbardian griffons, they became a minority in their own land. Many of them oppose Griffonstonian reign and yearn to reunite with their western brothers and sisters. Today a large demonstration took place in Wohnsitz, protesting Rumareans demanded a reunification of the region with the Barony. The demonstrators quickly turned to violence and a chaotic brawl with the police force supported by loyal Griffonstonians took place. Many were left wounded, some died, but ultimately unrest was contained, the demonstration wasn’t allowed to grow into something worse. In recent years Rumareans grew more and more radicalised; we expect more acts of violence to happen in the future especially if the terrorists will be supported by the new baron of Rumare, Alaric Dawnbreaker."

griffonstone.004.t:0 "A Rally"
griffonstone.004.d:0 "It is not easy to make Griffonstonians care about anything – while in many other places the horrific reality they had to endure would swiftly cause a violent revolution, here birds were just apathetic. Locals were spending their days fighting for scraps, trying to trick and rob the few tourists that were visiting the holiest city of the continent in these days of chaos and war. Convincing these griffons to think about something bigger than their day-to-day subsistence was hard work, but this was her work, the only one she wanted to do because she started to believe, thanks to two Equestrian ponies, that Griffonstone and its birds could be saved – had to be saved. And so, what initially seemed like a fool’s crusade started coming to fruition – now she stood in front of hundreds, maybe thousands of griffons, all waiting to hear her words. When Gilda entered the makeshift podium jerry-rigged from a bunch of crates, the crowds calmed down in anticipation. She cleared her throat and started talking,\n“Griffonstonians! Look around you. What do you see? Most would say, they see misery and ruin our great nation has fallen to. But that's not true! What I see is proud strong griffons. Griffons, willing and ready to unite, to work and fight for a better future. Old fools that rule Griffonstone look into the past, they ramble about the old glory and their divine right to rule. They hide in their crumbling palaces, tearing apart what remains from our once proud nation. For three decades they have been doing nothing to save Griffonstone. They will not help us; they don’t want to. It’s time for us, common griffons, to take matters into our claws and fix Griffonstone. It’s time to stop looking into our past, and start thinking about the future! Future, where griffons, all griffons, decide the fate of their nation. Only in such future we will be able to rebuild Griffonstone, a country restored by all griffons for all griffons!”"

griffonstone.005.d:0 "“Could you repeat once again what you said, lord Gestal? My hearing is not as good as it once was... And these godsdamned protestors are really loud today...” Protest outside seemed to be slowly coming to an end, protesters were getting tired of demanding “freedom and bread”. All was going as usual – probably even Kemerskai himself would not be able to gather Griffonstonians for long enough to organise a serious riot. However, one thing Gruff had to admit – Gilda was incredibly persistent, gathering her followers for protests time after time again.\n“Of course, chancellor.” lord Gestal was one of the few who addressed Grandpa by his actual title. “As probably all already know, the emperor is dead. My friends in the imperial court informed me about growing unrest and a struggle for regency. It is our duty to assist the Empire in an hour of need.”\n“Are you mad, Gestal?! You want us to join in on this chaos? We both know how divided are rulers of the Heartlands, they will be at each other’s throats by the end of the year. And what are we going to do now? March on Griffenheim?”\n“It is our duty. For too long have we ignored our duty to the crown, chancellor. If we do not support Griffenheim, the Empire may end up in the claws of a usurper, or – what's even worse – revolutionaries!”\n“Do not tell me about duty, Gestal! My duty is to protect Griffonstone, and as long as I breathe, we will not engage in hopeless wars in the North,”\n“I guess we will not have to wait long then.” said lord Purplebeak and started laughing. A few others followed his example. \n“Silence!” Gruff screamed. His voice sounded rejuvenated from the power of emotions he was experiencing. Those old enough recalled the days when he used to scream like this at new RGDF recruits. “This is pure madness, and you know it, Gestal. If we move North, Blackrock will burn Griffonstone to the ground. Griffenheim must clean its mess by itself.” Grandpa sighed. “The meeting is over; I need a nap.” he caught sight of a minister rolling his eyes, “Don’t you dare even wince at this, Purplebeak, when you’re my age, you will be in an even worse shape, you sack of fat!”\nLords left the council room one by one, only Gestal and Gruff remained. Just before leaving the room himself, Gestal turned around and said,\n“It is not just a duty chancellor; it is common sense to act when we have the chance. Otherwise, whoever wins will come for us to punish us for not supporting their cause... And if the republicans win,” he pointed at the window; the crowds were dispersing, save for a few stragglers flaunting their plaques and flags, “they will put our heads on pikes.” Grandpa waved his claw dismissing the lord. Gestal sighed and left the room. A few moments later Gruff’s clenched fist soundly hit the table,"

griffonstone.006.t:0 "An Unexpected Meeting"
griffonstone.006.d:0 "Assistant’s work proved to be more challenging than Gallus had initially thought. There was little tea-making, instead the commander of the Defence Force made the young griffon a de-facto adjutant. Doing paperwork, attending High Command meetings (which was a grandiose name for what really was a ragtag band of remaining old officers), and working as a courier. What was even worse, every few days Grandpa Gruff called Gallus to his office and examined him on whatever he claimed to learn recently. Considering Grandpa’s lousy standards, he could become a paragon of a ward... Instead, all he would hear on these meetings was complaints, screaming, and orders to handle piles of reports. He was told off and given extra work for making the smallest mistakes, as if he was also hired as Grandpa’s assistant! In effect Gallus was constantly tired and often didn’t pay attention to his surroundings. This time he was carrying orders to one of farther posts, when he bumped directly into a brown-white griffoness going around the corner.\n“Watch out! You... Wait, who the hell are you?!” Gallus was really unlucky today – of course, it had to be Gilda he had bumped into.\n“Aerm... Gallus. I’m Gallus. And I’m sorry, very sorry?” he tried to defuse the situation.\n“I do not know any Gal... Wait, you are that boy, Gruff cares for, aren’t you?”\n“If what he does can be called caring, then yes.” answered Gallus, “I’m really sorry, but I’m kind of in a hurry, you know, work to do, orders to carry...” \n“Whatever. Just get out of my sight, kid.” Gallus obliged, leaving Gilda alone. When anger wore out, she, probably for the first moment in her life, started thinking about Gallus and his situation. Apparently, he was now working for Gruff. The kid was always hanging around the old fool, at least for a dozen years now. For some reason Gruff ensured that he remained well-fed and taken care of... He even sent him to Equestria. It seemed weird that this unpleasant stingy old bird without any family whatsoever would care for a random orphan. What was so special about him? "
griffonstone.006.a:0 "“Interesting...”"
griffonstone.007.t:0 "The Proposition"
griffonstone.007.d:0 "Grandpa Gruff, as usual, didn’t pay much attention to the Regency’s council meeting. After two decades of futile attempts he has largely given up on trying to convince nobles into doing something to improve the miserable state of Griffonstone. Besides, almost all council meetings ended up in heated arguments that only led to stalemates – so why would he even give a damn? Usually lords would forget that Gruff was even there, and he could peacefully nap through the meetings, while they argued about whose ancestor stole the other’s herd of cattle or who cheated during the last game of cards... However, this meeting was different, everything seemed strange... Many lords were surprisingly composed and, apparently, talked about actual problems of Griffonstone – an event so unusual, that it broke the old griffon out of stupor. \n“Lords of the Council.” Of all griffons, Brightwing, was the most successful at behaving like a true statesman. “I think the time has come to stop fighting for at least a few months to deal with some dire issues. Rumareans are on the brink of a revolt, after a coup in Arantiga, its new ruler, baron Dorotheos, has been rapidly increasing the size of the army, Blackhollow is still a mess, yet, after the recent centralisation efforts, this mess started threatening us directly. If we do not act quickly, a war on all fronts is imminent. We must muster our forces and try to beat our enemies one by one before they come for us all at once.”\n“Brightwing, are you drunk already? It's not even noon yet. What forces? We are unable to gather enough soldiers to have good chances of victory in war against any of our neighbours. Also, if we attack one of them, the rest will use the opportunity to launch their assault.” Grandpa Gruff cooled the sudden militaristic enthusiasm of Brightwing. \n“I will provide forces. There are plenty of mercenaries ready to be hired, and doing it this way we will not weaken Griffonstone’s defences.” Suddenly spoke lord Goldstone. “Blackrock has loose control over the East. With one powerful strike her bandit queendom will collapse like a house of cards.” \nGruff looked suspiciously at Goldstone. Him willing to do something for the good of Griffonstone seemed very unusual. “And what’s the catch, Goldstone? You spending a single idol for the kingdom? Sounds as likely as Kemerskai reconciling with the imperials.”\n“Well... I will become the new count of Blackhollow if I succeed. Of course, I will immediately swear fealty to Griffonstone. All those who support me in this endeavour will be handsomely rewarded...”\n“Hmph.” Grandpa murmured. “Council shall vote then.” Of course, all of Goldstone’s cronies supported him, strangely, a large group of griffons who didn’t support Goldstone’s earlier proposals, including Brightwing, also voted in favour of the intervention. However, they didn’t make up a majority and voting ended up in a draw. It was up to Gruff, the chancellor, to decide..."

griffonstone.008.d:0 "A few hours ago it seemed like the day would proceed as normal: tiring hours of a staff assistant’s work. Gallus prayed for something to change the boring routine of these days... Well, apparently, the gods decided to answer these prayers in a very ironic way. Gallus was crawling through an old sewage pipe, wondering how the hell this all happened. Mercenaries, who had arrived earlier this day, suddenly started attacking the garrison of the city and in roughly an hour slaughtered all armed griffons who did not manage to escape to the old palace, which was now under siege. Luckily for him, Gallus was outside the palace during the initial attack, enjoying the few hours of his free time. Upon realising the gravity of the situation, he quickly dropped his uniform and ran away. Mercenaries were surprisingly disciplined, and shot civilians only if they seemed to pose some threat... Still it meant that while Goldstone’s soldiers were storming the palace and residences of rival nobility, city gangs could run unopposed, increasing chaos and mayhem. Decrepit sewage system was the best way to leave the city unscathed. \nAnd so, he crawled, a few times almost getting stuck in the narrow pipes. He was on the brink of panic, this experience made him realise just how much he hated narrow spaces! And the smell... Finally, he saw light. After crawling for a few dozen meters more, Gallus got out of the pipe. He looked around – he was well outside the city – far away from danger. For a few minutes he gazed at burning Griffonstone. Unable to act, paralysed by fear and anger, he could do nothing to save his hometown... Never in his life has he felt so small and powerless. The only thing he could do was to run away, saving his own skin..."

griffonstone.009.d:0 "It wasn’t long before news of Goldstone’s coup reached the rest of the country. Many nobles didn’t act on it, due to either supporting him or being unable to oppose his army. Lord Gestal wasn’t one of them, he quickly gathered his private army and, after joining forces with the remnants of the Royal Defence Force and lesser opposition members, marched directly on the capital. Now this colourful bunch set camp near the city, preparing for the assault.\n“According to interrogated escapees, Goldstone and his mercenaries managed to gain control over the city and are now digging in, waiting for reinforcements. Luckily, paramilitaries are delaying their advance. If we strike now, we should be able to reclaim the city and capture Goldstone. Without him, the rest of his cronies should disperse.” Klaus Steelfeather, the captain of Gestal’s army finished his report.\n“What about chancellor Gruff and council members that were inside the city?” asked Gestal.\n“We cannot be sure, but it seems that the chancellor was killed during the attack on the palace, and councilgriffs were captured.”\n“Thank you, captain.” Gestal was collecting his thoughts. Then he spoke up, “We can’t let Goldstone take power. He will destroy both us and Griffonstone, he will not stop until all of the riches are squeezed out of this land, until he has sold every remaining piece of our legacy for idols. We must win. Otherwise Griffonstone will have neither future, nor past. Gather your soldiers, gentlegriffs, we’re leave in an hour.”\nBefore the day ended Gestal’s forces stormed Griffonstone..."

griffonstone.010.t:0 "The Fallen Lord"
griffonstone.010.d:0 "Griffonstone has fallen. A city that has not been conquered by its enemies for centuries, the holy birthplace of Griffonkind now resembled a ruin. Yes, before the battle it was already a rotten slum, but after a whole day of vicious street combat whole districts got wiped out, it took hours to put out fires, some of which were caused by retreating mercenaries who tried to delay the advance of the nobles’ army. Gestal was heartbroken from seeing all this destruction and death – yes, Griffonstone has been slowly crumbling for ages, but he has never wanted to be the one who would finally throw it into oblivion... And now, to stop one madgriff, thousands had to perish. Bodies were piling up in places, where resistance was particularly harsh, and where fighting turned more into chaotic brawls. There were also countless civilian casualties, these griffons’ only fault was being at the wrong place, at the wrong time. Mercenaries proved to be surprisingly disciplined and loyal – most of them died fighting, a small number broke through the lines of besieging forces and escaped in the direction of Blackhollow Mountains. Only a few dozens were captured, now they were gathered on the city’s main plaza, alongside them stood their employer – lord Goldstone. The treacherous lord, was he not tied and gagged, would most likely try to attack griffons around him with just his bare claws and beak – in his eyes Gestal could see nothing but pure hatred. \n“Why is he gagged, lieutenant?” Gestal asked the officer overseeing prisoners.\n“My lord... To be honest I was simply tired from the endless stream of profanities and threats he was screaming out.” Gestal raised an eyebrow and moved closer to Goldstone. Tied-up griffon started twitching in his chains and mumbling angrily.\n“Lord Goldstone... What a pleasure to see you in the place where you belong. Your plan has failed, your cronies were captured. You are a despicable criminal, and I should order you executed here and now... But letting you live will be more cruel. Sitting in a prison cell, you will think of what could have been, had you come out victorious, every single day. It is up to me to clean up the mess you, power-hungry maniac, have created. Hopefully, I will do this quickly and won’t not have to think about you ever again. We will, I hope, never see each other again. Take him to the deepest part of the dungeon lieutenant."

griffonstone.011.d:0 "Old Guto’s palace was almost serene – with the last few bodies of defenders removed, only bullet holes and traces of blood reminded about brutal events that took place here just a few days ago. As most of the mercenaries were deployed in the city to take care of troublemakers, a group of nobles led by Brightwing traversed mostly deserted corridors. As they passed doorways of neglected rooms and once magnificent, now deteriorating works of art, collected by generations of Griffonstonian kings, Brightwing thought for a moment – the peaceful atmosphere of this place resembled that of a tomb.\nThey found Goldstone in the throne room – of course the leader of the plot was sitting on the old throne of kings, surrounded by heavily armed guardsgriffs. \n“Ah, welcome, welcome!” Goldstone's smile resembled one of a shark, “It is good to see you, my friends. I trust you faced no serious obstacles?”\n“Nothing worth mentioning.” said Brightwing, “As I can see, you already feel at home, lord Goldstone. Do you find the throne comfortable?”\n“Not really... It’s more of a burden, to be honest, all the responsibility, formal duties, and so on... But perhaps we should, as you always liked, cut to the chase, instead of discussing a piece of furniture.”\n“Indeed, lord Goldstone. We are now in control of Griffonstone, and I guess it is time to discuss the course of future action...”\n“I would rather like to discuss the past... For example, why it took you so long to arrive with reinforcements... I had to defeat Gestal all by myself...”\n“Well...” Brightwing tried to remain calm, however, all who surrounded him started discreetly moving away. “I was delayed by various factors: terrain, enemies’ assault...”\n“Very convincing.” Smiled Goldstone. “I would have probably believed you, had I not received a certain piece of correspondence, that my griffons managed to intercept... You really should pay more to your couriers; it was laughably easy to bribe them...”\nBrightwing shrieked in panic and tried to escape – he managed to make only a couple steps, before guardsgriffs opened fire. In a second lord was perforated by a hundred bullets.\n“Love the treason, but hate the traitor... Was it Arantigos or Grover?” Goldstone asked the rest of the nobles, who were still paralysed by fear and shock. “Whoever said that, I think it suits the situation quite well. Brightwing wanted to betray me, and got what he deserved. Think of it as a warning. His holdings will be divided between those who respected their part of the deal... Or at least were clever enough to hide their betrayal better than he did. Hopefully, they have already abandoned these foolish plans. I am not going to become the new king, it's boring, and takes too much time. In the future, a good puppet will be crowned. Until that point, I will rule as the regent...”"

Unless it's an invasion, fire, or good news, get out!” He said as unpleasant as he could. Doors however opened, revealing... lord Goldstone. “Goldstone? Why the Tartarus, are you bothering me? Do you have nothing better to do? Like counting money, basking in your complacency, or trying to further ruin Griffonstone?\n“Respectful and funny as always, Gruff.” noted Goldstone. Without permission he came in and sat down on a chair. “But I’m not here to discuss your manners. We need to talk, chancellor.”\n“Well, well... I do not remember you calling me chancellor... Ever? It must be serious then. Alright, since you’ve already ruined my afternoon, you can as well say what you want from me.”\n“It’s simple. Reconsider your decision on the expedition to Blackhollow. We cannot wait any longer or well... They will kill us, unless we strike first. It’s now or never, chancellor.”\n“Let me think, Goldstone...” grandpa tapped his pen on the desk, “No. I do not trust you; I do not trust your mercenaries and...” the old griffon leaned back on his chair, “...and I think that’s enough. Stop bothering me. And get out, I'm busy.” \n“You...” Goldstone’s feathers ruffled, “You, old fool!” he screeched and jumped forward. Piles of reports were launched from the desk, turning into clouds of paper, among which two griffons fought. A knife flashed in Goldstone’s claw, as he was knocking Grandpa over. They started wrestling. In a fit of rage, Goldstone was mindlessly trying to stab Grandpa, to no avail. Goldstone’s aim was rather poor, he was missing, only scratching Gruff’s arms and wings. To lord’s surprise, the old griffon suddenly grabbed his wrist, strongly gripping it. They struggled against each other for a few seconds, then, to Goldstone’s dismay, Gruff started pushing his knife-wielding claw away. He twitched his wrist around in desperation, hoping to slash Gruff’s hand. Then all went dark for a few seconds, as Grandpa hit Goldstone's head with his own... When Goldstone regained consciousness, he saw Grandpa, holding a chair over his head, preparing to take a swing. Moments later the piece of furniture got smashed apart on the lord’s temple. Gruff looked at unconscious Goldstone with contempt, catching his breath, kicked him once, and then screamed,\n“Guards! Godsdamned guards!”"

Doctor ordered Grandpa to rest – and no matter how upset by this fact the old griffon was – he apparently decided to comply. Finally, Gallus was ordered to visit Gruff in his crumbling home. Gallus knocked on the doors and in return heard,\n“If you’re a street trader or a preacher, go away! I do not need a set of pots, and I am not interested in our lord Boreas!” Gallus sighed and came inside. Grandpa Gruff was sitting in an armchair, most likely almost as old as him, in front of a burning fireplace.\n“It’s you, Gallus. Good, you are hardly late. The commander of the Defence Force is rather pleased with your current performance, and so I decided to assign you the role of administrator of some of Goldstone’s estates. Finally, I have an opportunity to throw out some lord’s rubbish and it's a good opportunity for you to learn something about land management.”\n“I have zero experience with managing anything bigger than myself!” objected Gallus, “It's a serious position to hold, choose someone with actual experience. Besides, what if I do not want to be a clerk and do all these chores for you? I’m tired of all this, I’m leaving now. I have some savings, should be enough to buy me a ticket back to Equestria or anywhere far from this dying city.” Gallus turned away and headed towards the door. \n“Wait.” Grandpa Gruff was surprisingly quiet and calm. “Yes, it may seem like too much of a burden, but, trust me, you will need this.”\n“Need this? For what?” \n“Perhaps...“ Grandpa stayed silent for a moment. He looked very old and feeble now, like the fire of anger and spite, that has been fuelling him for all these years, was slowly burning out. “Yes, perhaps it is the right time. I think, you know why I decided to become your guardian?”\n“Yes, I do. My grandfather was an old friend of yours, though I still can’t believe you actually had any friends, and when my mother died, you honoured his memory that way.”\n“Yes, your grandfather... He was a good griffon, and I could call myself not only his servant, but also a friend.” Grandpa smiled warmly.\n“Wait, have you gone senile? He was a cobbler from Wohnsitz just like my mother, and you were the captain of the Royal Guard,”\n“I’m talking about your paternal grandfather, King Guto of Griffonstone.” For a moment Gallus stayed silent.

All this time Grandpa was completely silent – he did not scream, he did not gesticulate, he simply waited – Gallus had never in his life seen Grandpa so composed and calm. Pieces of the puzzle started assembling in his head – Why would Grandpa Gruff, a spiteful and greedy old griffon, give a damn about anyone except for himself? Gallus always wondered why he had decided to become his guardian, and for all of his misgivings, Grandpa cared for Gallus. Not once in his entire life has he been underfed, he has received the best possible education, Grandpa even sent him to Equestria for that.\n“It makes zero sense, you told me that you did not know, and did not care for who was my father, as you had more important matters, like hemorrhoids, to care for.”\n“Guto’s line was extinguished, it was convenient for everyone. You were just a child of a cobbler and a prince, who’s never been crowned a king. Only a handful of griffons knew about you, and now most likely only I remain. No one would support your claims years ago, when you were just a little chick, but many wanted to see you dead. It was safer to hide you and your ancestry. But now... I’m old, too old and tired to do anything good for Griffonstone. I have been trying my whole life, meeting failure after failure. But you... You are the rightful king of Griffonstone, and perhaps, you are the only one able to bring some change. I know, I’m asking for a lot. But to rise from ashes, Griffonstone needs its king. It needs you, Gallus.” \nGallus stayed silent for many minutes. He was thinking – all these years he had thought he was just a miserable orphan, a no-one with no future and no past, a griff, unlikely to ever achieve anything meaningful. Just a burden on Grandpa’s finances. He thought about Griffonstone, his home – unlike Gruff he has never seen its days of glory – only its days of strife. For him, it was a ruined place with no hope for improvement. All this sudden knowledge and responsibility were overwhelming..."

It will never be back, it has no place in this new world, in this new age, and we can’t make time go backwards. The age of kings is gone, and one person will not change Griffonstone. I will not change Griffonstone. My whole life I’ve lived without a past... But I want to have a future. My own future, forged by me, not by some long-gone griffons. It is up to all Griffonstonians to rebuild their nation; we all must do this. Thank you for telling me the truth, now I know my past... But it will not determine my future.

There were only Gruff, and the desk he was sitting behind.\n“Gilda.” he managed to utter this word with minimal amount of disgust, “Finally!

"No, that would be akin to growing bored without rheumatism. But let’s make this conversation as short as possible. Thanks to Goldstone’s meticulous work of gathering dirt on various members of the council, I had more than enough reasons to banish them all... Goldstone’s cronies, in fact, have already run away out of fear for prosecution. As there aren't many griffons left in it, I dissolve the council, resign from the position of chancellor, and hand over the position of Griffonstone’s regent to you. You call yourself whatever you want – president, prime minister – I do not care. You have pestered me about transferring power to the citizens for years, now I give you the opportunity to do it. Don’t make me regret this. Any questions?”\nGilda’s beak dropped. For a moment, being in deep shock, she could not say anything, but finally managed to scream out one word,\n“What?!”\n“That’s not a very specific question. My time is precious, I’m eager to start enjoying retirement.” \n“But why now?! Why me?”\n“I have had a very... enlightening conversation with a certain person. I was thinking of leaving my office to someone else anyway. Better the demon you know, or something like that. You may be an insolent disrespectful bird, but at least you seem passionate about this whole democracy thing. Do not screw this up, Gilda, or I will kick your rear, even if I will have to return from the dead.” Grandpa Gruff shook his claw in a threatening manner.\n“If you could, old geezer!” \n“Well, whatever, all of the clerks were informed and so was the Royal Defence Force, no one objected, they will follow your orders. All of the necessary documents are on the desk.” he pointed to a set of folders. Grandpa stood up taking his chair with him, “And I'm taking this, I brought it from home! Good luck, Gilda...”"

griffonstone.201.d:0 "This morning the atmosphere in the council chamber was one of tension and barely hidden anxiety. Following Goldstone’s imprisonment many councilgriffons met with chancellor to receive an offer that cannot be refused. Documents obtained from Goldstone’s residence contained quite interesting information – correspondence that could easily place them in prison for collaboration with the traitor and other incriminating materials Goldstone had gathered through the years to use for blackmailing lords. Councilgriffons would be more than happy to tear them apart. However, with the documents in chancellor’s claws, their only hope was to follow his orders. Initially, the meeting took its usual direction with discussion of unimportant matters, that members of the council could argue about. After a few minutes Grandpa Gruff tapped his claw on the table to attract the attention of the council.\n“It’s getting late, and I’m already tired of this meeting, so let’s get to the point. The ineptitude that allowed for Goldstone’s attack proved that this council is incapable of working for the good of Griffonstone. That sleazy plotter tried to take power, and, considering how many of you voted to let him bring an army of mercenaries to the capital, apparently, every kind of stupid idea can get through council now. So, to prevent such incidents in the future, I have a proposition... Gallus!” Grandpa raised his voice, “Bring the documents!” The young griffon opened the doors to the council chamber, carrying a large pile of documents. For a long time, the only sound that could be heard was the rustling of pages, as lords were viewing the documents.\n“This is unacceptable!” Gestal was the first one to finish, “You want to effectively remove all power from our claws and turn the council into an advisory body...”\n“Yes!” Gruff was quick to interrupt him, “The council is as useful now, as stomach ulcers. It’s harmful for Griffonstone!” Gruff looked ominously at the council, reminding them about the proofs of their treason and other crimes he had obtained, “Let’s vote!”\nTo Gestal and other unaware members of the council, the results were shocking – though with only a slim minority, the council supported Gruff’s proposal. \n“Good.” Grandpa smiled, “Now, as things are settled, my first decision is to get a proper replacement for Goldstone. As it is now up to me to appoint new members of the council, I choose my protege Gallus. We need some fresh blood. That’s all for now, councilgriffons.”"

Command of defensive and offensive operations will be handed to councilgriffon Gallus.” Aforementioned Gallus ended reading a draft of the proclamation Grandpa was going to publicly read soon and sighed, “You know, that I have zero, I mean literally zero, idea on how to command troops? Most of what I got from attending staff meeting was the understanding of how complicated it was.”\n“You do not have to understand anything about it, as you will not be in actual command of the Defence Force. I want them to stay alive after all!” Grandpa Gruff was in his typical snappish mood today, “You know as much about it, as Wingbardians know about making good beer. But if you want to be accepted as a ruler, something more than just birthright will be needed. Military accomplishments are a good option. Why do you think every wannabe dictator wears a uniform?”\n“Fine, but please don’t force me to wear some kitschy uniform with lots of medals, that would be embarrassing.” responded Gallus. \n“With your attitude not even a feldmarshal’s uniform will help.

griffonstone.284.d:0 "It has been quite a while since Gilda had last visited the old royal palace – after the failed assassination attempt Grandpa Gruff was constantly working on actually governing the nation, and had no time to argue with her. She herself was constantly busy trying to keep her movement from falling apart. Indeed, it seemed that things were finally getting better in Griffonstone, as a result, the support for her cause was dropping drastically. Now however, Gruff was summoning her for a meeting – probably for the first time in his life. Her surprise grew even bigger when in the chancellor’s cabinet not only Grandpa was waiting for her, but also his young protege – Gallus. \n“I’m here. What do you want?” Gilda did not even greet Gruff, “I’m quite busy, don’t you know? I have to prepare a large batch of scones today, some of us do actual work around here, unlike you.”\n“Her scones are actually edible now, so indeed she does something instead of furthering our collective misery.” said Gallus, earning a deadly glance from the griffoness. \n“I did not invite you to discuss the disputable quality of your baking. Do I look like a cake festival contestant? We don’t live in a pony neighbourhood! What was I... Ah, yes, There were these two trouble-making ponies, each one had a unique way of being irritating, as only ponies can...”\n“Hey! One of these ponies is my friend!” Gilda was indignant.\n“Whatever. The important thing is that they tried to reclaim the Idol, and you were helping them. I want to know, what happened there, and whether you have actually seen the Idol.” \n“Yeah, I saw it moments before it fell deeper into Abyss. It’s hopeless. Rocks are prone to crumble, and the wind is strong enough that you cannot fly there."

It is useless.” Gilda said very slowly, separating her words with large pauses, “How many times do I have to repeat, that what we need is griffons working together for a better future, not some ancient trinket. It’s a lost cause. There is nothing left to say for me here...”\n“Gilda. Please...” Gallus interrupted her last sentence, “We really need all the information we can get. I need it. Please.”\n“Wait...” Gilda was collecting her thoughts, “You are going to go there?! Gallus, are you crazy? No, no you can’t be crazy, it must have been this senile idiot.” she turned towards Gruff, “You have finally lost it. I know it’s been hard for you after the king's death, but sending him...” she pointed a claw at Gallus, “...to try to reclaim the Idol? You are killing him to undo your old mistakes.”\n“No, Gilda.” Gallus spoke in a calming tone, “It’s not Grandpa's idea. It’s mine.” before she could say anything, he continued, “I need the Idol as a proof of legitimacy. No matter what I do, no one will accept me as the new king. Such attempt will lead to a civil war. But with the Idol...”\n“Legitimacy?! King?!” To say that Gilda was confused would be a great understatement. Suddenly an understanding came to her – all of her suspicions came true. “You must be joking! Have you told him, he is the last Guto?” she was trying to calm down, but laughter was getting the better of her. Gallus seemed a bit ashamed at the whole situation, but Grandpa stayed very calm – he was waiting for her to finish, “Boy, it may be cruel, but such is the truth – he is feeding you with some bullshit.” she said to Gallus, “He has gone mad from guilt years ago and now chose a random orphan to act as the child of his sovereign. It’s not a fairytale, it’s reality, brutal and unforgiving.” \n“I... You might be right.” Gallus lowered his head, “But I believe, he's telling the truth. And I know, that without the Idol, we will never be whole again as a nation. I must try.” Gilda stayed silent for a few long minutes and finally said to Grandpa, “Gruff, if you end up killing him, I swear, I’ll throw you into the Abyss for being a monumental idiot and wasting the life of a child...”"

griffonstone.205.d:0 "The royal palace was filled with griffons – in fact, crowds filled not only the throne room, but also the courtyard and an adjacent square. For the first time in over thirty years – the first time in lives of most gathered Griffonstonians, a new king would be crowned. At first, when griffons heard about the reclamation of the Idol, many reacted with disbelief – but all who would see the Idol, knew that the news were indeed true – just a sight of the artifact filled their hearts with joy and pride. No one had hoped that the Idol would ever again return to Griffonstone, and with it, a new rightful king. \nGallus was a bit nervous, but nevertheless tried to behave royally – the way he imagined what acting royally would be – keeping a stern look and a proud posture. However, after a few minutes of the ceremony, Gruff quietly commented, suggesting he should just try to relax because he “looked like suffering from especially painful constipation”. Gallus obliged. Priests, led by the prelate of Griffonstone, performed ancient rites, taking an enormous amount of time. Gilda, standing near to the throne, had was resisting an urge to yawn. Finally, the ceremony reached its culmination. The former regent, Gruff, handed the crown to the prelate, who crowned Gallus with it.\n“In the name of the gods, I crown you the King of Griffonstone. May Boreas grant you wisdom to rule fairly, may Arcturius fill you with strength to protect the Kingdom from enemies, and may Eyr bless your reign to be bountiful.” Prelate Silverfeather ended the old blessing. Gallus took a deep breath and rose from the throne. The time for his speech has come. \n“Citizens of Griffonstone... My friends... It was an age of hardships for us. Ever since Idol had been lost, it was a struggle. It was not easy for us to survive, but we persevered. Now, we stand strong, we stand united. There is still a long way ahead of us, but I believe... No, I know that we will do it. Past hardships will only make us stronger, and there will be a new age for Griffonstone, a better age. I promise to you, that I shall do everything I can to protect our home and to make it a better place to live. Griffonstone will never fall again!” \n“Long live the King!” someone in the crowd shouted. Moments later more and more griffons followed. It seemed like the old throne room was shaking from the combined voices of those inside. \nGrandpa Gruff wiped away a single tear. Finally, after all these years... He fulfilled his promise. The old griffon smiled and joined the cheering crowd."

griffonstone.206.d:0 "Ever since the Imperial City fell, Grover’s movements were confined to his palace, and each time he left his chambers, he was followed by at least one guard. Guards claimed, they were assigned just for his security – the city was dangerous, groups of bandits used the chaos, that followed the siege to expand their scope of operation – and dealing with them would take some time. All Grover could do, was to wait – soldiers claimed that soon “His Highness” would arrive, and each time they mentioned their ruler, they got very excited for some reason...\nThis day was no different from those before it. Grover decided to spend it reading – books helped him forget about the misery of his current situation. He barely noticed quiet knocking. Thinking it was just a servant with a meal or a soldier checking up on him, Grover said, “Come in.” without stopping reading. Doors opened and somegriff entered the room. \n“Interesting book? I’ve never been much of a reader, preferred to look for trouble. Books were always associated with lectures by old griffons on responsibility for me...” Grover raised his head, and saw a young, blue-feathered griffon. He would seem like a normal griffon, but there was something strange about him. Something that Grover could not explain – it felt like his figure radiated a light... The feeling however disappeared shortly. \n“Yes, it’s quite engaging.” the emperor answered politely, “And, may I ask for your name?”\n“Ah, I forgot to introduce myself, I’m Gallus. And you must be Grover von Greifenstein? I’ve never been much into dynasties, so, excuse me, if I messed it up.” he smiled apologetically, "

griffonstone.286.d:0 "“The pleasure is mine.” the emperor was not really sure what to say, so decided to stick with classic politeness. \n“So...” Gallus was visibly nervous, “I may only wonder what you were told about me...”\n“There isn’t much to tell. They told me, you were a usurper, claiming the throne of an extinguished line, fooling griffons with a forged Idol.” Grover was heating up, “And now you’ve conquered my home.” his tone became cold.\n“Ouch.” Gallus grimaced, “Do they really talk about me this badly in Griffenheim? To be fair, Grover, I myself have no idea if I really am a usurper or a rightful king. All that I have is words of one old griffon... But Griffonstone needed a king to clean up the mess it has become. So, I did my best. In general, there is lots of mess to clean up in Griffonia.”\n“Why are you talking about it with me? Shouldn’t you just claim the throne and call yourself emperor? With ‘the Idol’ and as ‘an heir of Guto’ you have all the rights to it.” Grover did not even try to conceal hostile sarcasm.\n“Well... I thought about it a lot. I do not want to do this. It’s simply wrong. When I found the Idol... I understood one thing – what it represented, unity of Griffonia – was a lie... At least it was a lie in the way that it was attempted to be achieved. Uniting griffons by conquest will only make the cycle repeat itself. And a shining artifact will stop it. Even if I, or you, reunited the Empire, it would just fall apart again... Do you think Aquileians, Wingbardians, the minotaurs will accept foreigners as their rulers? And then we would have another war for unification, even more devastating than the last... It's a dead end.” Gallus sighed, “The old must die, so something newer and better may rise. A world, where griffons follow because they want to, not because they’re told to, where they cooperate as friends, not subjects. The Empire is gone, Grover, bringing it back would be akin to reanimating a corpse. I believe, something better may be created. And I could use your help with that.

griffonstone.207.d:0 "The new tomb of Emperor Grover was located near the Imperial Palace, which now stood nearly abandoned, there was not much use for it now, as Griffonstone would be the new centre of power, only a handful of guards and servants remained to look after it. Gallus considered turning it into a museum – if left without use, such a magnificent building would fall into disrepair. However, it was a problem to deal with later. \nThe funeral gathered crowds – even though the Empire has met its end in ignominy, death made Grover VI a symbol of lost hopes for the future and of an age that would never return. And so, crowds of denizens of the Imperial City came out to follow their child-emperor on his last journey. A few days have passed since that, and Gallus decided to pay one more visit to the tomb, before leaving the city. As he was standing over the coffin itself, he heard steps – someone was coming. He turned around to see lord Gestal.\nThe lord himself hasn’t changed much, but seemed very tired. He bowed, addressed Gallus,\n“My King.” Then came to the coffin. They stood over it together for a minute, without saying a word. It was after they left the tomb that Gestal started to talk,\n“If I may ask, My King, are you planning to take the throne? I must warn you that after the death of Emperor Grover, the Duchess of Strawberry would be considered the rightful heir. In such case...”\n“No.” interrupted Gallus, “I am not. The Emperor has died, and with him, the Empire. It is over, lord... And before you start talking about my duty and rights, I ask of you to consider this – we have both just saw how this lust for power over Griffonia ends – with madgriffs murdering children. United Griffonia is a noble dream, that will always end with a nightmare. You only talk about the past, Gestal. We need to move forward. And I will go forward. What about you? Do not fight for the lost cause, find some other meaning in your life.” Gallus ended his speech, “And now, I need to go. There is plenty of things I need to do before leaving Griffenheim.” Gallus did not even wait for Gestal to respond – just walked away. The lord looked at him leaving, lost in thought. He felt old and tired – like never before. Has he sacrificed his lifetime... for nothing? He couldn’t answer that. Gestal sighed heavily, gave one last look to the tomb, and quietly said,"

Just a scared child.”\n“I’m not just a child! I am the Emperor of Griffonia.” Grover tried to take a regal pose.\n“Ah yes, my imperial majesty, what an honour.” the older griffon grinned; his eyes were cold and preying, “I have never actually met any Grover until now, and if you do not behave, many griffons will not have such pleasure. Are we clear on that?” After a brief moment of hesitation Grover nodded. The threat was more than obvious. “I am lord Goldstone, the regent of Griffonstone, and now also of the Imperial Heartlands. By the way, young emperor, I have to say, your throne is much more comfortable than the one I had in Griffonstone...”\n“Could we please discuss something more substantial than a piece of furniture?” plead Grover. For a brief moment Goldstone looked surprised. Then he started laughing... \n“I should be angry at you, young emperor, for interrupting me, but you reminded me of a certain conversation I had years ago in Griffonstone. It is a very pleasant memory. In return for amusing me I will cut to the chase. The Griffonian Empire will be dissolved, its days are long gone. Instead, the Empire of Griffonstone shall be created, and you, as a relative of the line of Guto shall be crowned its first emperor. Of course, for as long as I live, I will be in charge. And I plan to live a long and prosperous life. You will wave to crowds and open railroads... And do not think that you can outsmart me, I have battled griffons way smarter than you and won. And before you think about rambling about your divine right to the throne. I’m warning you – this is an offer I will make only once. You can refuse, and some terrible accident will happen to you soon. So, choose your words carefully”\nGrover had no intention to argue. He felt small, lonely, and weak. He was like a rabbit captured by a wolf – one snap and it’s over. He has heard some rumours about Goldstone from his servants – he was a despot, who got to power through bloodshed and plotting, there was little that could be done – at least for now. After a minute, Grover said quietly,"

griffonstone.283.d:0 "Since the beginning of the siege Grover has been confined to his chambers – at first, to ensure his safety – later, to ensure that he doesn’t flee from his captors. The siege itself felt like a nightmare to him – in the beginning, he saw fires and smoke coming from a distance and heard muffled sounds of artillery salvoes, later, when invaders reached inner districts of Griffenheim and attacked the palace itself, although it wasn’t a fitting action for an emperor to take, frightened by gunshots and screams, coming from other parts of the palace, he hid under his bed. Barkingian guard and remaining soldiers of the imperial army fought for every room of the palace... In the end, it was all for nothing – in time, nothing was left of them but lifeless hulks leaning on the bloodstained walls of the palace and laying in the corridors. Now Grover was in possession of the conquerors, all he could do was to stay in his room – soldiers were stationed outside the doors and in the gardens below the window, so trying to escape was truly hopeless. \nFinally, after long days of waiting, the officer, who was usually bringing him meals, ordered the emperor to follow him to “meet a very important griffon”. And so, Grover followed him through corridors of the palace, still scarred by gunshots and shrapnel, but cleaned of corpses and blood. Finally, they reached the throne room. Many of the rich decorations Grover liked were not there – which ones were destroyed in the vicious fight, and which ones were stolen by the attackers was unknowable to the child. The throne however remained untouched, and it was occupied by a middle-aged white-feathered griffon. Seeing a usurper on his throne made Grover clench his claws, breaking the apathy that set in during the siege. The older griffon on the other hand seemed mildly bored and completely unimpressed by the place, he was now clearly treating as his own,"

But this usual arrangement started getting better lately. Apparently, the new ruler of Griffonstone ordered to keep her in good health – both physical and mental, sometimes wardens would bring her books and, after restraining her wings, would take her on a walk around the castle’s yard. Nevertheless, her life still felt like torture – uncertainty and loneliness were taking a toll, she often spent nights sobbing.\nNow however, everything was going to change – wardens seemed to be very nervous, and one of them spilled out the reason – “The boss is coming to visit.” – Goldstone had finally decided to deal personally with his prisoner. Soon she was taken from her cell and led to what she supposed was the commander’s office of the castle – now occupied by lord Goldstone. Goldstone leaned back in a chair, whistling some joyful melody most likely from an Aquileian operetta. Except for him, inside the room there were two grim griffons in military uniform – his security. \n“Ah, countess Bluecrest.” Goldstone’s voice was full of false courtesy, “We have never had an opportunity to meet. I am lord Goldstone, the regent of Griffonstone and Herzland.”\n“He- Herzland?” murmured surprised Cyrille. \n“Ah yes, I forgot that news do not reach this mountain keep frequently. My campaign against the imperials was a stunning success, and now, Griffenheim is mine. But we’ve talked enough about me, let’s talk about your future. I guess, you would like to leave this place?” Cyrille started nodding frantically upon hearing this. “You see, unlike a certain idiot named Dawnclaw, I never get rid of useful assets. And now, I need someone to sit on the throne, to be the symbol of monarchy... Of a new empire I intend to create. With Grover gone, my options are limited. Bluecrests were related to Gutos at some point, am I correct? Genealogy has never been of interest to me.”\n“Yes. My great-grandfather married the daughter of Guto IV.”\n“Hm...” Goldstone pondered for a moment, “Could be better, I guess, but nevertheless, blood is not that crucial in this age.” he chuckled, “No, actually, it is, but in industrial quantities, not in the sense of relationships.” he seemed happy about his dark joke, “Well, countess Cyrille, I offer you a unique opportunity to become the new empress of Griffonstone. Of course, I’m sure, you understand that it will be a purely ceremonial role, and you know who will be in charge. Still it’s obviously much better than...”\n“Yes, yes!” Cyrille interrupted Goldstone, “I agree!” she was ready to agree to anything just to leave her prison cell.\n“Perfect. Now...

They are getting bolder with their raids every day, severely limiting our capability to trade. Equestrian economy has suffered immensely from the pirates already, and now we will have to reorganise our sea trade to counteract them. S.M.I.L.E. found some evidence suggesting that it is the Empire of Griffonstone which is responsible for funding and sheltering pirate fleets, however they can’t get concrete proofs, and we are not able to wage war in Griffonia now – our actions are limited to protecting our merchants for now."

Apparently, the Griffonstonian government decided to rejoin the Empire and offer full support for our crusade of Griffonian reclamation. The kingdom had nearly dodged a total collapse after the loss of the Idol of Boreas and the death of king Guto. Being plagued by poverty, despair, and inefficient governance. However, after a failed coup, attempt by lord Goldstone, his rival, lord Gestal, managed to establish a strong rule over the nation. A stern imperial loyalist, lord Gestal for many years has advocated for support of the Imperial cause, and now, as the regent of Griffonstone, he pledged his allegiance to us."

griffonstone.215.d:0 "Today lord Gestal proclaimed himself as the new regent of the newly restored Griffonian Empire. After reclaiming Griffenheim, he put emperor Grover VI back on his throne. While Grover will be tutored to take the throne in near future, Gestal will take care of the state’s affairs for now.\nAfter a military parade of victorious Griffonstonian soldiers, Gestal addressed the citizens of the Empire,\n“Subjects of the Empire, today I stand before you, not as a conqueror, but as a humble servant of our beloved emperor Grover. We live in a dark age, an age of war and strife, when nothing is certain, and even the greatest may succumb to plots of scoundrels and glory-seekers. But remember – the night is darkest before the dawn. For too long has Griffonia been suffering from revolutionaries, corrupt oligarchs, and foreign invaders. But the time has come for this dark era to end. The Empire will liberate Griffonian lands and bring everlasting peace and prosperity! And I promise to build a better, fairer Empire for you, and for future generations. We will prevail, Griffons, we will prevail, as our cause is just!”"

griffonstone.216.d:0 "It wasn’t long after new laws had been introduced, when Gilda had to face backlash for her actions. Although Gruff had cleared out the most radical elements of it, the nobility was ferociously protesting the new regulations, the perspective of losing influence made many of them temporarily abandon their usual bickering and unify under the aegis of lord Gestal. Being the most powerful of the remaining lords, he became the de-facto leader of the opposition. Now Gilda had to suffer through a meeting with him and a few of his supporters. Initially, when he had personally requested it, angered, she wanted to outright refuse, but after calming down a bit, she decided to at least hear them out. And so, they met in an old regency council chamber – which, with only a few griffons inside, felt empty and abandoned. \n“It is outrageous!” perorated Gestal, “We, the noblegriffs of Griffonstone, have led this country through centuries, we were the defenders of the throne and upholders of our nation’s great traditions! And now you want to cast us down! Revolution ruined the Empire, and now it will ruin Griffonstone.”\n“Ruin?” the anger in Gilda’s voice was barely concealed, “We’re already ruined. Mostly because of your actions. You had thirty years to bring us back on track. Thirty godsdamned years! It’s a miracle that you were not swept away by an actual revolution when you were just letting Griffonstone fall apart. There is no one on the throne and our traditions are the laughing stock of Griffonia. There will be changes, and you will have to adapt to them. No longer will Griffonstone be your playground, Gestal! If you disagree, feel free to emigrate to your beloved Empire. Now leave before I lose my temper!” Gestal’s entourage was visibly shaken by Gilda’s ferocity, but their leader’s mind remained unchanged. \n“I take it, there is no point in furthering this conversation. I will leave now, but know that I will not let this stand!”"

griffonstone.217.t:0 "Question of Compensation"
griffonstone.217.d:0 "One of the most dire issues of Griffonstone is land ownership, that’s why the key reform in the set that we’re introducing is the land reform – finally, our nation will cut ties with serfdom and transfer nobles’ land into direct possession of peasants. It is obvious that such actions will lead to a conflict with the nobility, but in our decisions, we shan’t waver! However, we can limit the backlash and dissuade some landowners from siding with Gestal by providing them with a compensation, in that way, the government will “purchase” the land, instead of outright seizing it, the downside to this is that we’re risking to put a great strain on our already devastated economy."

Finally, the day has come – Gilda announced that the kingdom of Griffonstone will be dissolved and replaced by a Republic – new elections took place and to no one’s surprise, the former and last regent, Gilda, won a landslide victory. In her first speech after swearing-in as the president she said,\n“Griffonstonians, today I stand before you not as your regent, not as your president, but as one of you – as one of proud griffons, who believed that they could change their country. Who believed that by acting together, by taking the matters into their own claws from the claws of their sovereigns they would restore their greatness. I want to thank you, all of you who believed in the republican cause. All this would not be possible without you. I promise to uphold the ideals you fought for and to do my best as your first president!”"

griffonstone.222.t:0 "Into the Abyss"
griffonstone.222.d:0 "When Gallus looked into the seemingly endless pit, he thought that perhaps it wasn’t best of his ideas – just looking down into it made him feel dizzy. The young griffon swallowed loudly, and took a firmer posture.\n“You know, it would be a good idea to not do this.” Gilda decided to accompany him and Grandpa on their way to the edge. Gruff grumbled something incoherent upon hearing her words.\n“Nah, I can do this.” Gallus tried to sound reassuring, but it was clear that the one who needed reassuring most was himself, “Well, it’s time to go.” one last time he checked his equipment, and started climbing. The wind was almost overwhelming, and the rock wall, full of cracks, was treacherous. On his way downwards Gallus stopped for a moment to look closer at the skeleton of dreaded cyclops Arimaspi. The skull was of enormous size. It didn’t seem weird that the beast managed to slay most of the royal guard and his grandfather. However, Gallus couldn’t stare at the remains for long – Gilda warned him that the rock was incredibly unstable, and prolonged waiting could be deadly. Luckily, at least during the initial stretch of climbing, his safety was protected by a belaying device. Still, the climb was challenging for the boy, his muscles ached insufferably, but he has managed to get only a short distance below. But he was committed, the only thing he could do now was to clench his beak and continue. As he climbed further and further, the wind started to weaken, allowing him to catch his breath. At this point, he did not see sunlight, all he could rely only on was a lantern. The rope, he was relying on to support him, had ended, from here only ice picks and his paws could let him continue. Suddenly, the worst imaginable thing happened – the piece of rock, he hanged on, broke off. Gallus lost balance and fell, screaming in panic. He tried to flap his wings, but the wind sent him flying into a rock wall, disorienting him. Moments later he hit the bottom of the Abyss."
griffonstone.222.a:0 "*THOMP!*"
griffonstone.223.t:0 "Rocky Bottom"
griffonstone.223.d:0 "The first thing he felt was intense pain. He treated it as a good sign – he was alive! And, what was even more important – his lantern lay not far, shining its faint light. The metal cage was badly deformed, but the glass inside remained intact. Gallus carefully checked his body – although there were lots of bruises, and his left wing was most likely unusable, he could still consider himself lucky – none of the bones in his legs and arms seemed broken.\nHe looked around – the bottom of the Abyss led to a cavern. Inside there were strange rock formations and tight passages, and no sign of the Idol... \n“OK, calm down, Gallus, it must be somewhere.” he said to himself. He started looking around. Finally, he noticed a blink in the distance. “A-ha! There you are!” Gallus moved forward confidently. But soon the passage started narrowing – he had to squeeze between the rocks. The lantern’s light seemed weaker and weaker...\nThe darkness hungered. Gallus breathed heavily; an inevitable panic attack was incoming. There was not enough space! He felt like the rocks were trying to crush him. The last frantic push took him out of the rocky jaws into a large open space. He started running forward in panic, then he stumbled and fell. The magical lantern untied itself from his belt and rolled into the unknown. Seeing this, Gallus screeched and lunged forward to catch it. He embraced the lantern, shaking and panting uncontrollably. The light seemed even weaker than before. Gallus put his head up, and looked around – he did not see the passage he came through. It was hopeless... He was foolish to venture to this place, and now he would die here alone in the dark. All he could do now was to wait for the inevitable end – to let death embrace him, and end this misery that his life was. \nHe started sobbing, recalling past events, he thought about those few good years in Equestria, about the friends he had met there. These warm memories were lightening his mood, calming him down. No, he had to come back – no matter, with the Idol or without it – he had to meet them once again. Gallus stood up and looked around. The darkness did not seem overwhelming now, as if it was retreating. For a brief moment Gallus felt something unusual... Like a fleeting feeling of anger. Then it was gone. Now he wanted to go forward, and so, he chose the most promising path..."
griffonstone.223.a:0 "...away from the darkness."
griffonstone.224.t:0 "The Last Guardian"
griffonstone.224.d:0 "Gallus was traversing passages and stone chambers, going deeper and deeper into the caverns below the Abyss, he had lost track of time. Finally, he once again saw a glimpse of light somewhere in the distance and started following it. After entering a large chamber, the light seemed to originate from, he did not, however, find the Idol.\nHe saw a middle-aged griffon, leaning against a stone pillar. In front of him lay a broken sword. The griffon seemed to be sleeping, but when Gallus came closer, he raised his head. What was a griffon doing in these forsaken caverns? And, even weirder, why did he seem familiar to Gallus?\n“Hello!” Gallus said, “Is everything okay? Who are you, and what are you doing in this hellhole?”\n“Hellhole?” griffon's voice was raspy, “Indeed, a suiting name for this place of my torment. Who I am... Who I was... Is it really important? Nothing is important here any longer.” \nGallus looked at the griffon more closely. He had seen this face before – when Gruff showed him old photographs from many decades before – it was his grandfather’s, king Guto VI’s! But how? He was supposed to be dead for three decades, slain by cyclops Arimaspi! And, somehow, he showed no signs of aging! “Wait, how... how is it possible?! You died a long time ago. Grandfather, what the Tartarus is going on?!”\n“Grandfather?” Guto seemed mildly surprised, “Has that much time passed? And you’re claiming to be my descendant? No, it does not matter. Nothing matters here. It is the end, the punishment for my failure. I have doomed the Empire, I have doomed Griffonstone.”\n“No, Griffonstone still stands. It struggles, it faces hardships, but it has not fallen yet.” replied Gallus, “Perhaps you have failed, but I can save your... our legacy. But I need the Idol. I need it, to prove who I am, to take the throne and save Griffonstone. Whoever or whatever you are, if you are really my grandfather... Help me find it.”\n“And why do you think it is worth finding? What does it say about us, if the only thing that keeps Griffonstone together is the Idol? It has brought nothing good to Griffonia, only bloodshed. And it will bring nothing good. Griffonstone is doomed. Let it fall, let it end.” Cried Guto.\n“No.” said Gallus firmly, “I refuse to believe in this. Yes, the Idol was used to conquer, but it also brought an age of peace and prosperity. And, I believe, this age can be brought back. Griffons may be weak, awful creatures, but, if given an idea, a symbol, I believe, they can unite to strive for a better future.”\nHis grandson’s fervour helped Guto recollect himself, “To have hope is the privilege of youth. You might be right.” Guto pointed his claw in the direction of one of the corridors, “I cannot go there, this is my penance. But you can.” \n“Thank you, grandfather. I will do what I can, to make you proud.” Gallus stepped into the passage. When he turned his head to say goodbye..."
griffonstone.224.a:0 "...Guto had already disappeared."
griffonstone.225.t:0 "The First One"
griffonstone.225.d:0 "This whole situation seemed... bizarre. Gallus was wondering if he wasn’t just hallucinating after suffering a serious head trauma, when he fell down the Abyss. Or, perhaps, he simply went mad after traversing these caverns for gods know how long? He knew, these questions were unanswerable, the only thing he could do was to push forward in hope that it will all become clearer later... It did not take long, as the passage widened into another chamber, in the middle Gallus saw the Idol! The golden artifact shined, reflecting the lamp’s light. It was magnificent. Entranced by it, Gallus stepped forward...\n“What do you think you are doing, usurper?” these words brought Gallus back to reality. He turned his head... Grover the First stood a few steps away – looking almost exactly like his depiction on a Griffonstonian monument. His face was contorted from contempt. “You want to claim the holy Idol, given to me by Boreas himself?! You? What right do you have to own it, thief?”\n“I am Gallus of the line of Guto.” The young griffon tried to sound firm with little success. “My ancestors protected the Idol, and it is my task now...”\n“Your ancestors?” Grover laughed. “You are just a random griffon, and even if you really are a descendant of my brother... You are weak. All of you are weak. My line is merely a shade of what it once was. You are not worthy of the Idol. You are a weakling and a coward. To command the power of the Idol is to become a conqueror, a ruler, the one who decides the fate of millions. Would you be able to do so, a child, filled with self-pity and anxiety?” Grover slowly approached, towering over Gallus, he was intimidating, “You are not worthy!”\n“Shut up!” screamed Gallus, “You are dead! Long dead! I do not know what is going on here, but you are just a ghost of the past, and you will not belittle me!” \n“Insolent youngling!” hissed Grover, “You think, you can oppose me? I have achieved the impossible, I have crushed ancient kingdoms, I have defeated my every foe, I am the chosen of Boreas! You think, you can defy me?” \n“Yes.” bluntly said Gallus, “All you can do is scream and threaten. And, you know what? I’m tired of this crap. My whole life, griffons were just screaming at me. I won’t give into this provocation.” Gallus turned around and grabbed the Idol..."
griffonstone.225.a:0 "..."
griffonstone.226.t:0 "Into the Light"
griffonstone.226.d:0 "The light. It was everywhere, all-encompassing, all-consuming. He was alone, in a sea of brightness. Gallus tried to look around, but could not even see himself – there was only light. It felt like he could just give up and melt in it, becoming one with it, to rest eternally in peace, not having to worry about anything. But he struggled, he fought. His senses were slowly returning to him... But something was approaching – coming like an unstoppable wave in a stormy sea. A presence. A force.\nAnd then it arrived. Even though he had no eyes, Gallus felt like he was gazing directly into the Sun. He felt pain, not a bodily pain, pain immaterial. If he could, he would scream. The presence turned its attention toward him. It was... judging him. He could feel interest, perhaps, a bit of amusement. His life, his actions, his thoughts... Everything felt meaningless in comparison to whatever he was facing now. Suddenly, the pain ended – the presence was content.\nIn the blink of an eye everything changed – Gallus found himself, sitting in a grandiose throne room. Treasures of hundreds of fallen kingdoms lay before him, beside them, defeated kings and lords were bowing, begging for mercy. He felt... powerful – powerful like never before. They feared him, but they also admired him – he was more than just a ruler, he was a paragon of a griffon. The feeling of power was intoxicating. That power could be his... That power was rightfully his... That power would be his! \nHe rose from his throne and grabbed his sword to command one more conquest... A thought appeared in the corner of his mind, a thought of doubt. Was it really the way, he wanted to follow? \nNo, he would not bring this kind of misery to Griffonia.\nAt first, it was a distant roar. Then everything began to crumble, revealing the scorching Sun, angered by his decision. To reject offered power... Arrogance must be punished, nobody can deny God. Yet, Gallus stood, looking directly into the light, once again he felt the pain, he was trying to overcome it. After what seemed like an endless struggle, the light started to fade. It was disappointed, but also intrigued and amused by Gallus’ resistance. He was free to go..."

griffonstone.227.t:0 "Back From the Abyss"
griffonstone.227.d:0 "Gallus woke up, gasping for breath. He felt like he rose from the dead, but after a few moments of panic, everything got back to normal. In fact, he felt... better, stronger than before. Though a huge bump on his forehead was aching, he felt reinvigorated. Gallus carefully looked around – he was once again on the bottom of the Abyss, and just a few steps next to him lay the Idol. \nHow? It was puzzling. Though the memories of what had happened were vague, he recalled meeting long-dead griffons... But how? Did he actually enter these caverns? And where was the entrance? He could see smaller chambers and rifts, but nothing that would resemble a large cavern, he had been exploring. Has he suffered a terrible concussion, after hitting the rock? Was he just laying here, next to the Idol all this time? These questions were unanswerable – and they did not matter – now all he needed to do was to grab the Idol and get back on the surface. Gallus strapped it to his harness and started to climb. For a brief moment he stopped, a strange feeling of... a sinister presence came, then quickly faded. \nAs Gallus continued to climb, a hooded, griffon-shaped figure stood at the bottom of the Abyss unnoticed. Burning with hatred, it was watching him. After a while it melted into the darkness, returning to the place where it truly belonged.\nWind seemed much weaker this time, and Gallus was quickly moving up. He did not feel tired, easily climbing up the rock wall, soon approaching the peak. He heard familiar voices.\n“It’s been over a day! If a young griffon like him did not manage to do this, no one will manage. You must be mad!” a female voice stated.\n“I’m not that old!” answered the old male one. “And it’s my fault. I will go for him... I should have never agreed to this plan.”\n“Two fools: one old, another young... Wait, do you hear that?” Gilda turned her head towards the edge of the Abyss. Moments later, Gallus pulled up one last time and got on the top, the Idol hanging off his hip, Gilda and Gruff were just standing there, stunned by the sight of the Idol. \n“No greeting party? I’m very disappointed. Don’t just stand there like marble statues. Do you have anything edible? If felt much longer than a day, I can tell you that.” "

Busy with managing the state’s affairs, Gallus did not have time to visit him very often, but each time he did, Gruff allowed for only a brief conversation, afterwards suggesting him to “go deal with more important matters, instead of bothering an old griffon”. Still, he seemed pleased by the fact that somegriff actually remembered about him and paid him regular visits. \nAs usual, grandpa was sitting in his armchair, covered with a blanket. He looked very frail, as if his aging had rapidly accelerated in the last few months. To Gallus he always looked the same through all these years, as if he decided to spite the gods by refusing to die. Griffons many decades younger could envy his vitality. Now however, all this was gone. Apparently, having been sleeping before the arrival of Gallus, Grandpa opened his eyes.\n“Ah, Gallus, what brings you here?” Gruff asked.\n“Do I need a reason to visit my old guardian?” responded the young griffon, “There was nothing in particular to do today, so I decided to pay you a visit and see how you are feeling.”\n“As usual.” Grandpa shrugged."

griffonstone.228.d:0 "“You mean old?” Upon hearing this, Grandpa pointed a claw at Gallus and said, “I’m young enough to beat you if you do not show me respect, insolent boy! Young ones these days... And do not think being a king protects you from my wrath!” Then Grandpa let out something resembling both a chuckle and a cough. For a moment they both stayed silent. “You know, Gallus... I’m proud of you.” Grandpa suddenly said.\n“Thank you...” Grandpa has been growing more and more friendly with his protégé lately, still, the years of his upbringing left a mark on the young griffon’s trust. His response was mildly surprised and cautious in tone, as if he was expecting some trap.\n“You will be a good king – you don’t care about power; you worry about griffons... That’s a rare quality these days. And you somehow managed to develop it despite the fact that I didn't even try to raise you properly...” Grandpa sighed heavily, “I was not a good guardian. Not at all. One of my many mistakes. The older you are, the more you think about the past and your misgivings, the less about the future...”\n“You were not that bad.” said Gallus, “I think, you have always tried your best, not only in my case, but also in Griffonstone’s.”\n“Well... Luckily, it’s now your turn to deal with this place. I know you’ll do better than I did.” Gruff smiled, “And now, if you may... Could you make tea for an old griffon? I think, the leaves are on the upper shelf...”\n“No problem.” Gallus went to the kitchen. It took a while to find tea in the labyrinth of jars on the shelves, but finally, he returned with a steaming mug. \n“I found only Asterionese...” something in Grandpa’s pose alerted Gallus, “Is everything alright?” The old griffon did not respond. A quick examination revealed that he was, in fact, dead. He looked much more calm than normal – relaxed, gently smiling, apparently, he did not suffer in his last moments. Gallus closed the old griffon’s eyes and whispered,"

Goldstone’s failed coup caused great unrest, sending the GRM into disarray, nevertheless, they’re bound to cause problems in the future. To stabilise Griffonstone, we must address this issue. The simplest solution will be to ban them and exile the most vocal opponents of lords’ rule. However, perhaps it would be better to make a deal with more level-headed leaders of the Movement and introduce some token reforms like a limited land reform and a permission for some members of the GRM (the most passive ones) to join the new Regency Council."

However, it was an alliance born out of promises of prosperity, not out of loyalty, which showed during the battle for Griffonstone – actions of Goldstone’s supporters were cripplingly sluggish. However, with Goldstone locked up, their shaky alliance collapsed, and Gestal didn’t face much opposition from them when he went on to take the regent’s seat. But now these nobles continue to passively oppose the new regent by simply to follow orders, refusing to pay their taxes, and, in the worst cases, outright waging low-scale wars against our forces. They are not a real threat, but we must deal with them to prevent further destabilisation. The obvious option is to attack their armies directly and then imprison the dissenting nobles. However, we can hand out some pardons and promises to flip some of them to our side and then let them do the dirty work – after they will be done with it, their forces will be too weak to pose a threat to us, and we will carefully monitor their actions."

With its interior destroyed during recent vicious skirmishes, the half-ruined palace really suited her grim thoughts. Lost in her thoughts, Gabriella almost failed to notice lord Gestal, who was waiting for her in the throne room.\n“My empress,” she twitched upon hearing these words. The lord bowed, “It is an honour to meet you, though I hoped it would happen in better circumstances.” \n“Lord Gestal, it is a pleasure to meet you.” Gabriela responded courteously, “I am most thankful for your contribution to the Imperial cause. You, lord, are probably one of the last few griffons who believe in the Empire and fight for it. Thank you.”\n“It was my duty to fight for it, my empress. It breaks my heart, that when the coup took place, we in Griffonstone were consumed by infighting instead of coming to help our emperor, gods, save his soul.”\n“I’ve heard of your struggle and Goldstone’s attempt to claim the throne.

Now, he crossed the border and took Gale, where all remaining nobles are joining him alongside their troops. This is the final showdown – if we defeat Gestal now, all resistance to our revolution will be crushed, and no one will be left to oppose the new government. Just like the last time, two battleplans were devised: a quick attack – the RGDF against the nobles, or a more tricky approach – we can try to bribe a part of the mercenary force to attack Gestal’s army from behind."

We expect, he won’t be ever again able to pose any threat to us. Our victory in this fight destroyed all remains of noble power – their armies are defeated, their lands are under government control, and most of the rebellious nobles are unable to resist us due to either perishing in the battle or being captured and locked up in our prisons. We have lost a lot, but perhaps through this bloodshed a new, better future will be born. It is up to future generations to judge our actions. There is just one last thing to do, before we can concentrate on other matters – decide the fate of captured nobles. Our more bloodthirsty followers suggest executing them as traitors and enemies of the state, but more moderate republicans suggest banishing them instead. "

Thanks to this, instead of fighting us, they continued indulging in their favourite pastime – arguing. Some of them, most notably those indebted, were actually pleased with the prospect of an influx of cash, that the compensation promised, and those more industrious started investing into industry. Traditionalists and Gestal supporters were the only two outraged groups. Unfortunately, the most popular response to our actions among nobles was leaving Griffonstone, selling whatever remains of their possessions to the highest bidder. Heading off to other nations’ courts, they took their financial assets with them, which increased the strain on your economy, already greatly weakened by the compensation policy."

griffonstone.245.d:0 "For years Gestal was a unifying figure for the nobility, and though he, without any doubt, is an ambitious and dangerous rival, now, due to the chaos caused by Goldstone's arrest and mass exodus of nobles, his influence waned significantly and he clearly started getting more and more desperate. For weeks he has been trying to form a unified force out of his followers to fight against our reforms. His efforts may seem futile for now, but if we let him continue, he may get his “army” to the point of posing an actual threat to us, perhaps even launching a reactionary coup. The best way of dealing with this problem could be “removing” Gestal. After all, Griffonstone is a dangerous place, and many accidents may happen when Gestal goes around the land, visiting his fellow lords..."

griffonstone.247.d:0 "The plan was simple – Gestal travelled with his crew and a dozen men of his personal guard in automobiles. Therefore, a single assassin couldn’t possibly carry out the operation, especially considering the fact that Gestal’s car was rumoured to be armoured. However, for many years small groups of bandits were infiltrating Griffonstone, attacking from Creeper Mountains. Some of the most dedicated republican supporters would pose as such bandits.\nInitially everything was going as planned – we armed our agents with rifles and a small anti-tank gun, we managed to figure out Gestal's next destination, and chose the perfect spot for an ambush on one of the mountain roads. Vehicle column was slowly moving through treacherous terrain when our griffons opened fire. Gestal’s guards proved to be well-organised and trained. They did not panic, responding with fire, trying to cover Gestal’s escaping car. The armoured vehicle proved resistant to rifle-calibre bullets and the anti-tank gun jammed. In effect, the entire secutity personnel was killed, but the lord himself managed to escape the ambush and got to the safety of the nearest town. Of course, we launched an “investigation”, but, rather predictably, the “culprits'' were not found. Gestal did not wait for the results to arrive, opting to flee Griffonstone the next day after the attack, heading in an unknown direction. Considering that he had little time to take any of his assets with him, he will most likely not have resources to further harm our cause. Unfortunately, there have already been rumours about the attack being too convenient for us to be an accident, staining our reputation."

For many years, despite the lord’s best efforts, his family seat’s power was slowly falling apart, though he was still faring quite well in comparison to many other noblegriffs. Now however, except for a few old servants, Gestal’s castle was deserted – his allies had left him, either leaving Griffonstone altogether or abandoning plotting with Gestal in favour of pursuing careers in business. \nNow he sat in an armchair, with a glass of wine on his coffee table – the glass has been full for at least an hour at this point. Gestal was recalling the events of the last few months, all the actions he took, he wondered – could anything be done now? Perhaps, Gilda was right, perhaps, the time of nobles has gone, now they were to step back into the shadows, and let the commoners rule themselves? One thing was for sure – he had lost, and all he could do was to accept it. There was no point in further fighting, he could only hope that not all ways of the old would be lost in this new age. \nGestal quietly sighed and said,"

What occurred later however was chaotic bloodshed. Our agitators failed to properly lead the locals, and panicking nobles responded by ordering to set fire to the city. In an ironic twist of fate, they got trapped in it, with most of them and their soldiers eventually succumbing to the inferno, the few that survived this horror were quickly lynched by furious Copperhillians.

Garner, a businessgriff-turned noble is in charge of the more conservative Griffonstone Prosperity League, he wants to liberalise the economy and retract some of the most controversial reforms.

When she entered, the identity of the voice became clear it was Gallus. The boy had come to visit his guardian. \n“Give us a few minutes, Gallus.” said Gruff. The young griffon nodded and left the room. Gilda took a seat.\n“As you can see, I’m not dead yet. I’m not going to leave you anything in my testament.” grumbled Gruff, “I allow you to sign the list of birds wanting to piss on my grave, but you’ll have to do it with your own pen!”\n“Very funny. As I can see, you’re training for the show you will put on in the heavenly cabaret?” responded Gilda with a sneer.\n“Nah, I hate heaven. Constant family meetings in gardens with golden drinking fountains. I was fed up with these griffons when they were alive, and now they will bother me for all eternity.” \n“I’m sure they are not thrilled by the prospect of meeting you either.”\n“Yes, most likely. We’ve never gotten along well.” For a few moments both griffons sat in silence. “I was wrong about you, Gilda. You have many flaws, but you did a good job. Better than I ever could have done. Thank you.” Grandpa looked her in the eye. To say that Gilda was shocked would be a large understatement – Grandpa Gruff said something nice for once?\n“Uh... I just did what had to be done. And it would be impossible for me to achieve anything without all of the griffons who supported me.” she muttered.\n“Yes. And that describes the difference between us. I’ve lost my faith in others long ago. Eventually, I lost faith in myself too and stopped caring. But you still cared, even if you pretended not to. You cared about Griffonstone... Now I have one humble request, just one. Look after Gallus. He is still young and foolish and might get into trouble...”\n“Right. I guess, I can spare some time for him. But tell me, why have you become his guardian? He is not from your family, and you don’t seem that charitable. Is there some secret?” \n“Well...” Grandpa Gruff smiled, “He is the only grandson of an old friend of mine. One of a few I’ve ever had. By raising Gallus, I’m paying off my debt before him. A griffon should always pay off his debts. I will not hold you any longer, you have lots of duties, I suppose. And if you can, on your way out, find a nurse and tell her to bring me a glass of water.

griffonstone.282.d:0 "An unimaginable disaster happened to our nation. In the recent retreat the Idol of Boreas was lost to be captured by our enemies, while the Idol does not grant the supernatural powers it used to possess in the days of old, it still remains a symbol of immense power and stability, and, sadly, it doesn't serve us anymore."
griffonstone.282.a:0 "We're doomed..."
griffonstone.281.t:0 "The Idol was Captured"
griffonstone.281.d:0 "In our most recent attack we gained something much more useful than a piece of land – we found the Idol of Boreas, left by our enemy in retreat! The artifact does not grant the fabled powers upon its bearer anymore – that much we've known ever since it was reclaimed. However, now it serves as a symbol of griffon glory, and owning it is a matter of great international prestige."

griffonstone.288.t:0 "Griffonstone In the UPE?"
griffonstone.288.d:0 "The ambassador of the Central Griffonian Confederacy has delivered us a petition for them to join the United Ponies' Alliance. Letting them join will provide us with a strong ally in Griffonia, whose ideology is not far from ours, but, on the other hoof, this may force us to take part in future wars overseas..."
griffonstone.288.a:0 "We can always use new friends."
griffonstone.288.b:0 "Politely refuse."

griffonstone.290.t:0 "We Are Alone"
griffonstone.290.d:0 "Sadly, Equestrians have refused, claiming they cannot engage their resources over the sea and put themselves in danger of waging wars in Griffonia."
griffonstone.290.a:0 "We'll have to cope with that."
griffonstone.299.t:0 "The Triumph"
griffonstone.299.d:0 "Goldstone could not deny himself the pleasure of occupying the largest and most opulent office of the Imperial Palace with a perfect view of Griffenheim. He wasn’t going to use it often – he preffered his personal residence. But it was important to remind his imperial puppet, whose coronation was due to happen tomorrow, about who is really in charge. Goldstone stretched out his paws and put them on the desk. The last few years were really stressful and filled with work, but now, everything was promising to be simpler. With the power of Herzland behind him, no one could threaten his position, and new opportunities were seemingly endless. Even if something would go wrong – he was prepared. He had allocated large sums of money in New-Marelandian and Macawian banks – they could allow him to live in prosperity for many, many decades. Goldstone chuckled, recalling the words Grandpa Gruff had screamed, moments before he ordered to gun down the old fool – “You’re not getting away with this!”, “I’ll get you in the afterlife and kick you into the deepest part of oblivion!”, “I will be avenged!” Well... Gruff was now rotting in a shallow grave, while Goldstone sat in the Imperial palace of all places! Such an outcome would make one wonder if gods’ justice was even a thing – but, perhaps, they simply favoured winners... Sun was slowly setting over Greiffenheim – the time to leave was coming – there were still things to be done, money to be made, and the tomorrow’s coronation had to be attended. Goldstone wasn’t enthusiastic about that last prospect at all – he would have to put in some serious effort to not fall asleep from watching this lengthy process – luckily, he wouldn’t be the one performing all of the meaningless ceremonies. But, for now, he could relax, and so he decided to take a few more minutes to gaze at the city below."

griffonstone.300.t:0 "Maarnacht"
griffonstone.300.d:0 "Fear is inseperably connected to the night. Some say, that with the dawn of the Modern Age, creatures whom lurked in the shadows since time immemorial have faded, only for legends to remember them; that in the age of electricity and progress there is no place for darkness. But no matter how hard we try to light up the night, shadow will always remain... And it will always hunger. The longest night of the year is known as Maarnacht – the night when the god of death turns his attention to the world of mortals... the night when he rules freely. It is not a good night to be alone, nogriff should spend it without others. When the Sun sets, all griffons invite their relatives to live out these long hours together. They leave bones and eggshells on their doorsteps to drive off anything that might try to get into their homes – it will find only death and leave to search for other prey. Inside, elders talk about half-forgotten heroes of long-gone ages while griffons sit and divine truth from the shadows that dance in unison with the flames of numerous candles, for it is said, that during this one night, not only death can be found in shadow. Sacred tradition calls for all who are in the middle of a journey to be let inside – so that no one has to spend this night away from safety. When the night ends, griffons leave their homes to enjoy the sunrise – the time of darkness is over, evil powers return to slumber. Although there are those who consider Maarnacht a foolish tradition, there are rumours that some of the votives disappear from holy shrines during this night. Maybe they're just taken away by wind or rascals... Maybe..."

griffonstone.301.d:0 "Griffonstone's location in the centre of the continent is both a blessing and a curse – this great position offers great opportunity for international trade and brings the danger of being invaded by neighbours wanting to control crucial routes through Central Griffonia. Though we do not want to be dragged into wars of others, we may be forced to fight for our freedom, having allies would be extremely beneficial in such conflict – or it could outright prevent it. Of course, we may simply reinforce our neutrality and hope for the best..."

After removing the inept Regency Council and reforming their government, Griffonstonians have established a democratic government and now wish to align themselves with our republic.

griffonstone.292.d:0 "A diplomat from Griffonstone has visited our capital and requested a meeting. Apparently, Griffonstonians wish to join the Karthinian Pact, hoping to form closer bonds between our nations. By accepting them into our alliance we would give up on the idea of claiming the Home of Griffons for ourselves, but we would gain a valuable ally in the north."

griffonstone.303.t:0 "Imperial Coronation"
griffonstone.303.d:0 "Griffonstone was bustling with activity not seen since decades. Tens of thousands arrived to attend the imperial coronation - truly symbolic end of the dark age of both the Griffonstone and the Empire. Royal Palace was filled to the brim with griffons wanting to see this epochal moment. In a brief speech of the now former regent, lord Gestal, he thanked all these who stayed true to the imperial true and helped to defend Empire in its darkest hour. Following this, representatives of the provinces of the Empire and leaders of its most important noble families pledged fealty to the Emperor. Then the archon of Boreas bestowed a crown upon Grover’s head. Ceremony would conclude with the newly crowned emperor’s speech. \n“People of the Empire! This has been a long and perilous journey for me... For all of us. It was a time of war and strife, when many might have lost hope. But despite it, the brave griffons of the Empire fought for the better future, the prosperous future, one of peace and stability. I swear to you, my brothers and sisters that I will do all I can to uphold this dream of better Griffonia. The new age is coming, the golden age and we will all march towards it, together!”"
griffonstone.303.a:0 "Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!"
griffonstone.304.t:0 "Duty Fulfilled"
griffonstone.304.d:0 "It was a long day - military parade, religious ceremonies, coronation itself.... Speeches, speeches and even more speeches. Imperial coronation was probably the largest festivity Griffonstone saw for decades. Kaiser decided to honour Griffonstonians for their role in protecting and reclaiming the empire by letting their regiments to lead a parade of restored Reichsarmee, while lord Gestal himself was granted a title of duke of Griffonstone. Now however, as midnight has long passed, Gestal grew more and more tired with the coronation party he had to participate in. Officials and nobles, their small talks and puny plots to gain favour with the former regent... He wasn’t caring much for it. Now, he decided to look for peace in a quiet corner of the ballroom. Gestal really started to feel his age - all these years of struggles and both literal and political battles exhausted him. Long gone were days when he could work all day and night - now all he wanted to do was to nap until dinner, and later go back to bed. He wondered, how did Gruff manage to be so lively... Perhaps it was just pure anger and spite that powered the deceased chancellor? Of course peace never lasts and Gestal noticed a familiar figure wearing a general uniform. \n“Sir.” Klaus Steelfeather, now generalmajor in restored Reichsarmee approached his former employer. “May I bother you for a few minutes? I brought a bottle of wine and glass to celebrate your great success.”\n“Thank you for remembering about me cap... generalmajor.” Gestal instinctively called Steelfeather by his old rank. Officer poured wine to glasses and asked: “What the toast will be, sir?”\n“For the Empire of course.” They both raised glasses. “For the Empire...”\n“What are your next plans sir? I’m sure there is still much for you at the court...” \n“No, generalmajor. I did my job and now I would only be an obstacle. It is up to young ones like our emperor to decide about future of Griffonia... I... I think I need a rest. A long rest. I had no time to visit my estate for three years. I guess I’ll go fishing in Rumare Lake, and finally do something about rosegarden.” Gestal smiled fondly."
